The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company's investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company's term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.
The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company's investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):

| Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument   | Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase   | Potential Impact                    | 2024   | 2023    |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------|---------|
| Investment portfolio                 | 100 basis points, all tenors          | Decline in fair value               | 2,755  | $ 3,089 |
| Term debt                            | 100 basis points, all tenors          | Increase in annual interest expense | 139    | $ 194   |
