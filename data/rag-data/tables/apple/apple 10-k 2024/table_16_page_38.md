For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product.  For  third-party  applications  sold  through  the App  Store,  the  Company  does  not  obtain  control  of  the  product  before  transferring  it  to  the  customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.
Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):
