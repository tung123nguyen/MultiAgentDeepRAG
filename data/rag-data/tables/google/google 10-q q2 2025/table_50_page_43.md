APAC revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Japanese yen, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the South Korean won and Australian dollar.
Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real and Mexican peso.
