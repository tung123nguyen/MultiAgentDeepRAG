Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses segment operating income (loss)  to  allocate  resources  to  our  segments  in  our  annual  planning  process  and  to  assess  the  performance  of  our  segments,  primarily  by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.
The following table presents revenue, profitability, and expense information about our segments (in millions):
