Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&amp;E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.
The following  tables  summarize  our  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  marketable  securities  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis  (in millions):
