Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent  available  or  alternative  pricing  sources  and  models  utilizing  market  observable  inputs  to  determine  fair  value.  For  certain  marketable  debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&amp;E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.
The following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):
