We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns.

Gains and losses arising from other derivatives are primarily reflected within the 'other' component of OI&amp;E. See Note 6 for further details.
