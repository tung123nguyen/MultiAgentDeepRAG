The carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). Gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on OI&amp;E. Certain of our non-marketable equity securities include our investments in variable interest entities (VIE) where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for further details on variable interest entities.
The carrying values for marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions):
