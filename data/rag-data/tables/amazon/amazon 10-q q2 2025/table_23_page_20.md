Total segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, other long-term investments, corporate facilities, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and tax assets. Technology infrastructure assets, which are included in property and equipment, net, net additions, and the depreciation and amortization expense on these assets, are allocated among the segments based on usage, with the majority allocated to the AWS segment. Usage of technology infrastructure assets by the North America and International segments, and the related allocation of total net additions, can fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and is affected by seasonality, peak periods, new product or service offerings, and other factors.
Total segment assets reconciled to consolidated amounts are as follows (in millions):
