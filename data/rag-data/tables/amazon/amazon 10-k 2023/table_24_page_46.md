Included in other income (expense), net in 2022 and 2023 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(12.7) billion and $797 million from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. ('Rivian'). Our investment in Rivian's preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian's initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2023, we held 158 million shares of Rivian's Class A common stock, representing an approximate 16% ownership interest, and an approximate 15% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian's board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $2.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The investment was subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022.
