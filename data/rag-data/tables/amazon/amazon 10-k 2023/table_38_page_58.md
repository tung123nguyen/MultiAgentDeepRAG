We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the 'Credit Facility'). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $1.0 billion and $682 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, which had an interest rate of 5.6% and 6.6%, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we have pledged $1.2 billion and $806 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.
As of December 31, 2023, future principal payments for our total long-term debt were as follows (in millions):
