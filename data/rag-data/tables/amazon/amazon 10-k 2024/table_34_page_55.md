## Goodwill
The goodwill resulting from the acquisition activity is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition activity is generally not deductible for tax purposes. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2023 and 2024 by segment (in millions):
