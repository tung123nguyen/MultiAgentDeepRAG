(3) Intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are in-process and used in research and development activities are considered indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the research and development efforts. Once the research and development efforts are completed, we determine the useful life and begin amortizing the assets.
Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangibles was $604 million, $706 million, and $838 million in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Expected future amortization expense of acquired finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2024 is as follows (in millions):
