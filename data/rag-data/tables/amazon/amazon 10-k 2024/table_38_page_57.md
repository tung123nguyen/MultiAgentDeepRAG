As of September 30, 2024, we had repaid outstanding borrowings and terminated the secured revolving credit facility with a lender that was secured by certain seller receivables (the 'Credit Facility'). The Credit Facility bore interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and had a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $682 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023, which had an interest rate of 6.6%. As of December 31, 2023, we had pledged $806 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility.
