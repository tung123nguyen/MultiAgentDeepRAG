## Free Cash Flow
Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow. We provide a free cash flow measure because we believe it provides additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by 'Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.' The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, 'Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,' for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and 2025 (in millions):
