(2) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily as collateral for real estate, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, standby and trade letters of credit, and licenses of digital media content. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as 'Accounts receivable, net and other' and of twelve months or longer as non-current 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets. See 'Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies.'
