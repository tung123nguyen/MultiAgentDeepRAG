Class A common stock equivalent of restricted stock units (RSUs) with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, approximately 16 million and 95 million shares of RSUs were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, respectively, as including them would have an anti-dilutive effect.
The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
