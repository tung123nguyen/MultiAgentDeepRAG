Changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the full year 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Using these constant rates for full year 2024, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $165.37 billion and $161.51 billion, which were $874 million and $880 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively.
