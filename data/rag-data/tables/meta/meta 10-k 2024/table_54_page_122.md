Revenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include certain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating segments. Indirect operating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical security expenses are mostly allocated based on headcount. Costs related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure are generally allocated to our segments based on estimated usage, most of which is allocated to the FoA segment.
Beginning  in  2024  annual  reporting,  we  adopted ASU  2023-07  retrospectively.  The  following  table  sets  forth  our  segment  information  of  revenue, expenses, and income (loss) from operations (in millions):
