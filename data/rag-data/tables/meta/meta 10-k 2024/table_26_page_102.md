In  2022,  we  initiated  several  measures  to  pursue  greater  efficiency  and  to  realign  our  business  and  strategic  priorities.  These  measures  included  a facilities  consolidation  strategy  to  sublease,  early  terminate,  or  abandon  several  office  buildings  under  operating  leases,  a  layoff  of  approximately  11,000 employees across the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects (the 2022 Restructuring). As of December 31, 2024, we have completed the 2022 restructuring initiatives.
A summary of our 2022 Restructuring pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, including subsequent adjustments, is as follows (in millions):
