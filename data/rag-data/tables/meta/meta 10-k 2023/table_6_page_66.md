- Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least  one  of  these  Family  products  through  a  mobile  device  application  or  using  a  web  or  mobile  browser  in  the  last  30  days  as  of  the  date  of measurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active  community  of  people  using  our  products.  For  additional  information,  see  the  section  entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
