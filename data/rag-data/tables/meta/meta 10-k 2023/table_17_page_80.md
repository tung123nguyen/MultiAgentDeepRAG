Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $65.40 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $24.67 billion from December 31, 2022. The increase was mostly due to $71.11 billion of cash generated from operations, and $8.46 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in May 2023. These increases were partially offset by $28.10 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $19.77 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $7.01 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards.
The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):
