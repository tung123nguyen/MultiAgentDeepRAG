In March 2023, we announced three rounds of planned layoffs to further reduce our company size by approximately 10,000 employees across the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) segments (the 2023 Restructuring). Impacted employees in our recruiting, technology, and business groups were notified during March 2023 to May 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we have completed these employee layoffs. In certain regions, a small portion of the impacted employees continue to be included in our reported headcount through 2024. We recognized $1.20 billion pre-tax severance and related personnel costs across the FoA and RL segments during the year ended December 31, 2023 in accordance with ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , where applicable.
A summary of our 2023 Restructuring pre-tax charges, including subsequent adjustments, recorded for severance and related personnel costs during the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows (in millions):
