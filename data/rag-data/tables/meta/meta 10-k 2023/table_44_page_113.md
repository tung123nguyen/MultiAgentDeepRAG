During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed business acquisitions with total purchase consideration of $467 million in cash, including $88 million and $352 million allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, respectively. Goodwill generated from these business acquisitions was primarily attributable to expected synergies and potential monetization opportunities. The amount of goodwill generated that was deductible for tax purposes was not material.  Acquisition-related  costs  were  immaterial  and  were  expensed  as  incurred.  Pro  forma  historical  results  of  operations  related  to  these  business acquisitions have not been presented because they are not significant to our consolidated financial statements, either individually or in aggregate. We have included the financial results of these acquired businesses in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in millions):
