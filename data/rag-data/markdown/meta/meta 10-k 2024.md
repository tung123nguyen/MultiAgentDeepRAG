All  statements  contained  in  this Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  other  than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words "believe," "may," "will," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "intend," "expect," and  similar  expressions  are  intended  to  identify  forward-looking  statements.  We  have  based  these  forward-looking  statements  largely  on  our  current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, shortterm and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Annual Report  on  Form  10-K  may  not  occur  and  actual  results  could  differ  materially  and  adversely  from  those  anticipated  or  implied  in  the  forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

Unless  expressly  indicated  or  the  context  requires  otherwise,  the  terms  "Meta,"  "company,"  "we,"  "us,"  and  "our"  in  this  document  refer  to  Meta Platforms,  Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation,  and,  where  appropriate,  its  subsidiaries.  The  term  "Family"  refers  to  our  Facebook,  Instagram,  Messenger,  and WhatsApp products.

## Family Metrics

The numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We report our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP) and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our "Family metrics") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our "Family" of products) during the applicable period of measurement.

While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates  of  our  user  base,  and  such  estimates  may  change  due  to  improvements  or  changes  in  our  methodology.  We  regularly  review  our  processes  for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.

In addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base that have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.

Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore  must  seek  to  attribute  multiple  user  accounts  within  and  across  products  to  individual  people. To  calculate  these  metrics,  we  rely  upon  complex techniques,  algorithms  and  machine  learning  models  that  seek  to  count  the  individual  people  behind  user  accounts,  including  by  matching  multiple  user accounts  within  an  individual  product  and  across  multiple  products  when  we  believe  they  are  attributable  to  a  single  person,  and  counting  such  group  of accounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further below, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally  will  be  approximately  3%  of  our  worldwide  DAP. At  our  scale,  it  is  very  difficult  to  attribute  multiple  user  accounts  within  and  across products  to  individual  people,  and  it  is  possible  that  the  actual  numbers  of  unique  people  using  our  products  may  vary  significantly  from  our  estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.

To calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy

## LIMITATIONS OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER DATA

of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).

We  regularly  evaluate  our  Family  metrics  to  estimate  the  percentage  of  our  DAP  consisting  solely  of  "violating"  accounts.  We  define  "violating" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with  Facebook  and  Instagram  accounts  that  appear  to  be  inauthentic  to  the  reviewers,  but  we  have  limited  visibility  into  WhatsApp  user  activity  due  to encryption.  In  addition,  if  we  believe  an  individual  person  has  one  or  more  violating  accounts,  we  do  not  include  such  person  in  our  violating  accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.

## User Geography

Our estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by user location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.

We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos, videos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build the next computing platform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.

Across our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.

We report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.

We invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery engine,  the  metaverse  and  wearables,  Threads,  monetization  of  our  products  and  services,  platform  integrity  and  community  support,  and  infrastructure capacity.

The majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure  as  part  of  our  efforts  to  develop  our  apps  and  our  advertising  services.  We  are  also  making  significant  investments  in  our  metaverse  and wearables  efforts.  This  includes  developing  virtual,  mixed,  and  augmented  reality  devices,  software  for  social  platforms,  neural  interfaces,  and  other foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the next computing platform is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.

## Family of Apps Products

- Facebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a place for people to share life's moments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover and connect to people with shared interests, and create economic opportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups, Marketplace, and more.
- Instagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, Live, and messaging are places where people and creators can connect and express themselves through photos, video, and private messaging, and discover and shop from their favorite businesses.
- Messenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls.
- Threads. Threads is an application for text-based updates and public conversations, where communities come together to discuss topics of interest. People can connect directly with their favorite creators and others who love the same things or build a loyal following of their own to share their ideas, opinions, and creativity with the world.
- WhatsApp. WhatsApp  is  a  simple,  reliable,  and  secure  messaging  application  that  is  used  by  people  and  businesses  around  the  world  to communicate and transact in a private way. Within WhatsApp we launched WhatsApp Channels, a one-to-many broadcast service designed to help people follow information from people and organizations that are important to them.

## Reality Labs Products

Many of our Reality Labs investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products that are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets people control their devices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation interfaces. In the near term, we are continuing to develop early metaverse and wearables products and experiences that help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere.

Our metaverse efforts include our VR, MR, and social platform initiatives. Our current product offerings in VR include our Meta Quest devices, as well as software and content available through the Meta Horizon Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance while engaging in gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. To drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have introduced MR capabilities, which allow users to experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta Quest devices.

Our wearables efforts include our AR initiatives. We have continued to advance our roadmap to include additional AI-enabled offerings such as the RayBan Meta AI glasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as other features such as hands-free interaction. As we continue our long-term efforts to bring AR glasses to market, in 2024 we also unveiled our Orion prototype, a pair of true AR glasses that overlay content on top of the physical world. It does this with an industry-leading field of view and in glasses form factor for comfortable wear.

In  general,  while  all  of  these  investments  are  part  of  our  long-term  initiative  to  help  build  the  next  computing  platform,  our  metaverse  efforts  also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our wearables efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term research and development projects. For example, in 2025, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our wearables initiatives, and the remaining 50% on our metaverse initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are certain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the next computing platform and our business strategies evolve.  In  particular,  we  regularly  evaluate  our  product  roadmaps  and  make  significant  changes  as  our  understanding  of  the  technological  challenges  and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.

## Competition

Our business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and augmented, mixed, and virtual reality products and services. We also expect to face  additional  competition  as  we  introduce  or  acquire  new  products,  as  our  existing  products  evolve,  or  as  other  companies  introduce  new  products  and services, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new technologies as well as efforts to develop the metaverse.

## Technology

Our product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products like video, VR, and MR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is also provided by third parties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate our products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network capacity.

We make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend  relevant  content  across  our  products  through  our  AI-powered  discovery  engine,  enhance  our  advertising  tools  and  improve  our  ad  delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new products as well as new features for existing products.

We also believe in the power of open source innovation and have released our Llama models, consisting of state-of-the-art foundation models that are available  for  researchers  and  developers  to  use  and  build  upon.  By  making  our  Llama  models  openly  available,  we  aim  to  accelerate  AI  research  and development, improve our own products, and to foster collaboration and innovation within the broader tech community.

## Sales and Operations

The majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that is  focused  on  attracting  and  retaining  advertisers  and  providing  support  to  them  throughout  the  stages  of  the  marketing  cycle  from  pre-purchase  decisionmaking to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers. We operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners.

For our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers, resellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel, Meta.com. These efforts are focused on driving consumer and enterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.

## Marketing

Historically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world.

## Intellectual Property

To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.

## Government Regulation

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and regulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.

These U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and  regulations  are  often  uncertain,  particularly  in  the  new  and  rapidly  evolving  industry  in  which  we  operate,  and  may  be  interpreted  and  applied inconsistently  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction  and  inconsistently  with  our  current  policies  and  practices.  For  example,  regulatory  or  legislative  actions  or litigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various  ways,  including  for  advertising,  or  otherwise  relating  to  content  that  is  made  available  on  our  products,  have  in  the  past  and  could  in  the  future adversely  affect  user  growth  and  engagement,  affect  the  manner  in  which  we  provide  our  services,  or  adversely  affect  our  financial  results,  including  by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was  at  issue,  but  it  ultimately  declined  to  address  Section  230  in  its  decision.  In  addition,  there  have  been,  and  continue  to  be,  various  other  litigation concerning,  and  state  and  federal  legislative  and  executive  efforts  to  remove  or  restrict,  the  scope  of  the  protections  available  to  online  platforms  under Section  230,  and  any  such  changes  may  increase  our  costs  or  require  significant  changes  to  our  products,  business  practices,  or  operations,  which  could adversely affect our business and financial results.

We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In  addition,  the  other  bases  upon  which  Meta  relies  to  transfer  such  data,  such  as  Standard  Contractual  Clauses  (SCCs),  have  been  subjected  to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage,

<!-- page break -->

of such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a "qualifying state" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the "Data Privacy Framework List," maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF replaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European  Union  privacy  regulator,  the  IDPC,  and  includes  significant  penalties  for  non-compliance  with  the  notification  obligation  as  well  as  other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those regulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result,  the  interpretation  and  enforcement  of  the  GDPR,  as  well  as  the  imposition  and  amount  of  penalties  for  non-compliance,  are  subject  to  significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users  with  similar  data  privacy  rights  and  controls. These  laws  and  regulations  are  evolving  and  subject  to  interpretation,  and  resulting  limitations  on  our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services  provided  to  all  or  certain  cohorts  of  users  in  those  states,  adversely  affecting  our  advertising  business.  In  Europe,  evolving  interpretation  of  the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or  similar  developments  have  adversely  affected,  and  may  in  the  future  adversely  affect,  our  advertising  business.  For  example,  in  response  to  regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from "legitimate interests" to "consent," and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a "subscription for no ads" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets Act (DMA), and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our "subscription for no ads" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024, reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation in March 2025. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our  compliance  with  consumer  protection  laws.  In  response  to  these  developments,  in  November  2024,  we  began  offering  users  in  the  European  Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads,

<!-- page break -->

which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.

Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union  imposes  restrictions  and  requirements  on  companies  like  ours,  including  in  areas  such  as  the  combination  of  data  across  services,  mergers  and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have passed  legislation  implementing  data  protection  requirements,  new  competition  requirements,  or  requiring  local  storage  and  processing  of  data  or  similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For example, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas, California, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to minors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of existing laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also subject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could subject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third parties in such transactions.

We are and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities  and  regulators  in  the  United  States,  Europe,  and  around  the  world,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  privacy,  data  use,  data  combination,  and  data protection,  including  with  respect  to  processing  of  sensitive  data,  data  from  third  parties,  data  for  advertising  purposes,  data  security,  minors,  data  subject rights,  safety,  law  enforcement,  consumer  protection,  civil  rights,  content  and  content  moderation,  use  of  our  platform  for  illegal,  illicit,  or  otherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required  us  to  significantly  enhance  our  practices  and  processes  for  privacy  compliance  and  oversight.  The  FTC  also  continues  to  monitor  us  and  our compliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.

## Human Capital

At Meta, everything we do is about helping people feel connected and closer, and we are proud of our unique company culture.

We had a global  workforce  of  74,067  employees  as  of  December  31,  2024,  and  we  have  offices  in  more  than  90  cities  around  the  world.  We  are committed to fostering an enriching environment for our workforce and we are focused on supporting our people in doing the best work of their careers. We offer competitive compensation and a wide range of benefits, including many learning and development resources.

From time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, we have previously undertaken cost reduction efforts such as scaling back budgets, reducing company perks, shrinking our real estate footprint, and employee layoffs and restructurings. We make it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and provide a generous severance package. For U.S. employees, that includes severance payments, payment for all remaining paid time off, and restricted stock unit vesting through their last day on payroll, as well as certain continuing coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families, career services with an external vendor, and immigration support. We offer similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States while taking into account local employment laws.

## Employee Learning and Development

We value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled workforce. We aim to provide all of our employees with regular performance reviews twice a year as we believe it is an important part of how we support their growth and career development while also recognizing and rewarding their impact at Meta. We also offer career development opportunities and work experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, we utilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning, self-service resources, learning communities, and coaching engagements.

## The Pulse of Our Workforce

Each year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help us understand how employees feel about working at Meta and what we can do to improve their experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, team, and personal experience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such as those that have been administered daily to an ongoing random sample of employees, allow us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and company changes. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive change across the company.

## Compensation, Benefits, Health, and Well-being

We offer  competitive  compensation  to  attract  and  retain  the  best  people,  and  we  help  care  for  our  people  so  they  can  focus  on  our  mission.  Our employees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have conducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. For example, in September 2024, we announced that we continue to have pay equity for gender globally and ethnicity in the United States.

Through Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we continue to provide our employees and their dependents with resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community,

<!-- page break -->

and time away, including family building benefits, family care resources, retirement savings plans, access to legal services, Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta, and health and well-being benefits.

Our health and well-being programs are designed to give employees a choice of flexible benefits to help them reach their personal well-being goals. Our programs are tailored to help boost employee physical and mental health, create financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employees build a strong community.

## The Strength of Our Workforce and People Processes

In early 2025, we announced changes to our diversity programs in light of the shifting legal and policy landscape. We will continue to work to build an inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.

We want our products to work for people around the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to do that. We remain committed to having a skilled, inclusive and diverse workforce with a broad range of knowledge, skills, political views, backgrounds, and perspectives because we believe cognitive diversity fuels innovation. To aid in this effort, we have taken steps to reduce bias in our people processes and tooling, including our hiring processes and performance management systems.

## Risks Related to Our Product Offerings

## If we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.

The size of our active user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to increases  and  decreases  in  the  size  and  engagement  of  our  active  user  base  from  period  to  period  at  different  points  during  the  pandemic.  In  addition,  in connection  with  the  war  in  Ukraine,  access  to  Facebook  and  Instagram  was  restricted  in  Russia  and  these  services  were  then  prohibited  by  the  Russian government, which contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any future declines in the size of our active user base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.

If  people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we and our  competitors  introduce  new  and  different  products  and  services. Any  number  of  factors  can  negatively  affect  user  retention,  growth,  and  engagement, including if:

- users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;
- we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;
- users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;
- users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;
- user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;
- we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;

<!-- page break -->

- there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices, concerns about the nature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to privacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;
- we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;
- we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;
- we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products;
- users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise available;
- there are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely affect our products or users;
- we are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, or are otherwise limited  in  our  business  operations,  as  a  result  of  European  courts  invalidating  the  EU-U.S.  DPF  or  regulators,  courts,  or  legislative  bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States are invalid;
- there is decreased engagement with our products, decreased efficiency of our advertising products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part  of  changes  that  we  have  implemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with the GDPR, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, the DMCC, U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), youth social media laws, or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;
- technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or otherwise objectionable content, or users feel their experience is diminished as a result of our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our platform;
- we adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or we take, or fail to take, actions to enforce our policies, that result in our removal of users from our platform or are perceived negatively by our users or the general public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board regarding content on our platform;
- we elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement (for example, we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult experience in the long term);
- we make changes in our user account login or registration processes or changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;
- initiatives  designed  to  attract  and  retain  users  and  engagement,  including  the  use  of  evolving  technologies  such  as  generative  artificial intelligence, are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, our competitors, or other third parties, or otherwise;
- third-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are scaled back or discontinued, or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases;
- there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certain countries,  internet  shutdowns,  or  other  actions  by  governments  that  affect  the  accessibility  of  our  products  in  their  countries  (for  example, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, our user growth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian government);
- we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;

<!-- page break -->

- we, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user data practices; or
- our current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third-party applications.

From time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees. If we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to grow revenue.

## We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm our business.

Substantially  all  of  our  revenue  is  currently  generated  from  marketers  advertising  on  Facebook  and  Instagram. As  is  common  in  the  industry,  our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfied for any other reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the demand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.

Our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:

- decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;
- our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;
- product  changes  or  inventory  management  decisions  we  may  make  that  change  the  size,  format,  frequency,  or  relative  prominence  of  ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;
- our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;
- our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;
- changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;
- adverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that may impact certain advertisers' ability to advertise on our platform or our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;
- user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we monetize at a higher rate, such as our Feed and Stories products, including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or messaging products;
- reductions of advertising due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform or that we believe are needed to comply with global content, security, or integrity obligations;

<!-- page break -->

- the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;
- loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;
- limitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe as a result of European courts invalidating the EU-U.S. DPF or regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that the legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States are invalid;
- limitations on our ability to deliver ads to users under the age of 18 and, in some cases, to continue to offer certain products or services to certain cohorts of users, whether voluntarily, as a result of new laws, regulations, or government actions in the United States and other jurisdictions, or otherwise;
- changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;
- decisions  by  marketers  to  reduce  their  advertising  as  a  result  of  announcements  by  us  or  adverse  media  reports  or  other  negative  publicity involving us, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products (including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;
- reductions of advertising by marketers due to illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable content made available on our products by third parties, questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding regulatory developments or their own legal and compliance obligations, including with respect to artificial intelligence;
- the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users consent to, opt out of, or reduce the use of data for ads, including as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DMCC, U.S. state privacy laws including the CCPA, and other laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability  to  use  data  for  advertising  purposes  (for  example,  in  response  to  regulatory  developments  in  Europe,  we  began  offering  our  users  a "subscription for no ads" alternative in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland, and subsequently in November 2024 provided users in those regions who elect to continue receiving our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads);
- the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;
- changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;
- the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;
- changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and
- the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies, which in turn can have broader effects in other regions (for example, the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian government have adversely affected our advertising business in Europe and other regions, and advertiser spending also can  be  subject  to  adverse  effects  from  conflicts  in  the  Middle  East  or  the  implementation  of  tariffs  by  the  United  States,  China,  or  other governments).

From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or other factors in the future, including our enforcement efforts, could result in a reduction in marketer spend or demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, could cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether, or could otherwise negatively affect our revenue and financial results, and could be material.

Our ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals generated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.

Our ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other U.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing additional rights for users and could result in restrictions on our use of signals from third-party apps and websites through certain browser- and device-based universal  opt-out  mechanisms.  Judicial  and  regulatory  guidance,  decisions,  or  enforcement  actions,  or  new  legislation  in  these  or  other  jurisdictions  may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example,  in  response  to  regulatory  developments  in  Europe,  we  announced  plans  to  change  the  legal  basis  for  behavioral  advertising  on  Facebook  and Instagram  in  the  European  Union,  European  Economic Area,  and  Switzerland  from  "legitimate  interests"  to  "consent,"  and  in  November  2023  we  began offering users in the region a "subscription for no ads" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our "subscription for no ads" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.

In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the  ability  to  limit  our  use  of  such  data  signals  to  improve  ads  and  other  experiences  on  our  products  and  services,  including  changes  implemented  in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.

These developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.

## Our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.

The substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to

<!-- page break -->

competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the usage of our products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively, while expanding their own advertising business. In addition, Google previously proposed phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to Apple's, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally,  in  order  to  deliver  high  quality  mobile  products,  it  is  important  that  our  products  work  well  with  a  range  of  mobile  technologies,  products, systems,  networks,  and  standards  that  we  do  not  control,  and  that  we  have  good  relationships  with  handset  manufacturers,  mobile  carriers,  and  browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or  the  operation  of  our  business  based  on  what  we  believe  to  be  in  our  long-term  best  interests.  Such  actions  may  adversely  affect  our  users  and  our relationships  with  the  operators  of  mobile  operating  systems,  handset  manufacturers,  mobile  carriers,  browser  developers,  other  business  partners,  or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.

## Our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

Our ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes  to  our  existing  products  or  acquire  or  introduce  new  and  unproven  products,  including  using  technologies  with  which  we  have  little  or  no  prior development or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making significant  investments  in  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  initiatives  across  our  business.  For  example,  we  continue  to  launch  new AI  features  on  our  products, including support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and editing tools. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.

In addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of such products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or  profits  from  messaging  over  the  long  term.  Our  efforts  to  implement  default  end-to-end  encryption  across  our  messaging  services  on  Facebook  and Instagram have been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. For example, the Nevada Attorney General is seeking to enjoin our offering of default end-to-end encryption on Messenger for all Nevada residents under the age of 18.

If our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to  attract  or  retain  users  or  to  generate  sufficient  revenue,  operating  margin,  or  other  value  to  justify  our  investments,  and  our  business  may  be  adversely affected.

## We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

We  are  making  significant  investments  in  AI  initiatives,  including  generative  AI,  to,  among  other  things,  recommend  relevant  content  across  our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance could be harmed.

<!-- page break -->

There are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI and there can be no assurance that the usage of AI will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. For example, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI, subject us to risks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation and deepfakes (including related to elections), bias, discrimination, toxicity, consumer protection, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among others. It is also uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. In addition, we are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

As a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various governmental and regulatory agencies in jurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering applying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, export controls, and data protection laws to AI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI (such as the recently passed EU AI Act). We may not always be able to anticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these frameworks as they are still rapidly evolving. We may also have to expend resources to adapt to new legal frameworks, and adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.

Further,  we  face  significant  competition  from  other  companies  that  are  developing  their  own AI  features  and  technologies.  Other  companies  may develop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Given the long history of development in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Our AI initiatives also depend on our access to data to effectively train our models. Further, our ability to continue  to  develop  and  effectively  deploy  AI  technologies  is  dependent  on  access  to  specific  third-party  equipment  and  other  technical  and  physical infrastructure,  such  as  processing  hardware,  network  capacity,  computing  power,  and  related  energy  requirements,  as  to  which  we  cannot  control  the availability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment.

We are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license agreements to third-parties that can use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not have insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize such  AI  technologies.  As  such,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  third  parties  will  not  use  such  AI  technologies  for  improper  purposes,  including  through  the dissemination of illegal, inaccurate, defamatory or harmful content, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, furthering bias or discrimination, cybersecurity attacks including spear phishing attacks, data privacy violations, other activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or to develop competing technologies. While we may mitigate certain risks associated with the improper use of our AI models through both technical measures and the inclusion of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective. Such improper use by any third party could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.

It is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations or other regulatory developments regarding the use of AI, including restrictions around the collection and use of data, may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal liability.

## We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.

We frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our "Your Activity off-Meta Technologies" tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly,

<!-- page break -->

from time to time we update our Feed display and ranking algorithms or other product features to improve the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products, which could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products,  or  introduce  new  stand-alone  products,  that  attract  users  away  from  properties,  formats,  or  use  cases  where  we  have  more  proven  means  of monetization, such as our Feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.

## We may not be successful in our Reality Labs strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

Our Reality Labs efforts include our metaverse and wearables initiatives. We believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in social technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life, and we are directing our efforts toward innovations in AI, wearables, and devices to help build next-generation interfaces. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as well as privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build is uncertain. We regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve. In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with thirdparty mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own competing products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition, content regulation, tariffs, export controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our Reality  Labs  strategy  and  investments  may  not  be  successful  in  the  foreseeable  future,  or  at  all,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  reputation,  or financial results.

## If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to maintain or expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.

We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, terms of service, or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, generative AI, younger users, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or geopolitical events, which has adversely affected, and

<!-- page break -->

may  in  the  future  adversely  affect,  our  reputation  and  brands.  For  example,  in  January  2025,  we  announced  certain  changes  to  our  content  policies  and enforcement efforts to further free expression on our platform and mitigate over-enforcement of certain of our content policies. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents relating  to,  among  other  things,  our  algorithms,  advertising  and  user  metrics,  and  content  enforcement  practices,  as  well  as  misinformation  and  other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of content on our services, or to practices by advertisers or developers, that are illegal, illicit, or in violation of our policies, or fail to otherwise enforce our policies, address objectionable content or practices on our services, or address other user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands.

Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around geopolitical events  or  elections  in  the  United  States  and  around  the  world,  by  decisions  or  recommendations  regarding  content  on  our  platform  from  the  independent Oversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, by our decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service, or by any negative sentiment associated with our management.

Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other  content,  as  well  as  user  well-being  issues,  have  eroded  confidence  in  our  brands  and  may  continue  to  do  so  in  the  future.  If  we  fail  to  successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.

## We may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products.

We have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications that integrate with our products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that integrate with our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of  our  efforts  related  to  privacy,  safety,  and  security,  we  conduct  investigations  and  audits  of  platform  applications  from  time  to  time,  and  we  also  have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.

## Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results

## Our business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.

We compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content

<!-- page break -->

and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and augmented, mixed, and virtual reality products and services. We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new technologies, as well as efforts to develop the metaverse.

Some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us  to  new  or  emerging  technologies  and  changes  in  market  conditions.  We  believe  that  some  users,  particularly  younger  users,  are  aware  of  and  actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In addition, from time to time we make updates to our products and services to improve the user experience (including to help provide users with safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences), and these changes have had, and may in the future  have,  the  effect  of  reducing  time  spent  and  some  measures  of  user  engagement  with  our  products  and  services.  In  the  event  that  users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.

Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; by limiting the ability of our devices or products to interoperate with their popular platforms or products; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems, search engines, browsers, or ecommerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.

We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:

- the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;
- the size and composition of our user base;
- the engagement of users with our products and competing products;
- our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;
- the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;
- our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;
- our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;
- our ability to monetize our products;
- the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;

<!-- page break -->

- customer service and support efforts;
- marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments;
- our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our products;
- our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;
- changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;
- acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;
- our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly specialized technical personnel including software engineers, designers, and product managers;
- our ability to cost-effectively manage our operations; and
- our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.

If we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad impressions may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

## Our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.

Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial  results  in  any  given  quarter  can  be  influenced  by  numerous  factors,  many  of  which  we  are  unable  to  predict  or  are  outside  of  our  control, including:

- our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad impressions;
- our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;
- our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers or advertising agencies or resellers in a particular period;
- fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, or other factors;
- the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;
- the enforcement of our advertising policies, including the removal of ads and marketers from our platform;
- the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;
- changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;
- the pricing of our ads and other products;
- the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;
- our ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we may introduce in the future;

<!-- page break -->

- changes to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;
- user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;
- increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses, as well as capital expenditures, that we will incur to grow and expand our business and  to  remain  competitive,  including  costs  related  to  our  data  centers  and  technical  infrastructure  as  well  as  other  costs  relating  to  our  AI initiatives;
- costs related to our privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts, including as a result of implementing changes to our practices, whether voluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or otherwise;
- costs and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;
- our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;
- costs related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies;
- charges associated with impairment or abandonment of any assets on our balance sheet, including as a result of changes to our real property lease arrangements and data center assets;
- our  ability  to  obtain  equipment,  components,  and  labor  for  our  data  centers  and  other  technical  infrastructure  in  a  timely  and  cost-effective manner;
- system failures or outages or government blocking that prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;
- breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;
- changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party actions;
- fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;
- refunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;
- share-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;
- adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;
- changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection, antitrust, content, or AI, or actions by governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;
- the overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects of share-based compensation, the effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and the effects of discrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;
- the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;
- tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently under by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;
- fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;
- trading activity in our share repurchase program;

<!-- page break -->

- fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our non-marketable equity securities, and in interest rates;
- the incurrence of indebtedness or our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms;
- changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and
- changes in regional or global business, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions, which may impact the other factors described above.

## Unfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business.

We receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Our reputation has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, advertising policies, product decisions, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit  or  objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our community standards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, our management, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours. For example, we have been the subject of significant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with geopolitical events and elections in the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.

## We are subject to the risk of catastrophic events and crises, which may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations.

We  are  subject  to  the  risk  of  public  health  crises  such  as  pandemics,  earthquakes,  adverse  weather  conditions,  other  natural  disasters,  terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, power loss, cyber-attacks, and other catastrophic events and crises. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic previously significantly impacted our business and results of operations. In particular, the pandemic led to volatility in the demand for and pricing of our advertising  services  at  various  points  throughout  the  pandemic,  and  we  may  experience  similar  effects  in  the  future  as  a  result  of  the  pandemic  or  other catastrophic events. Such events also expose our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including: volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement; delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of inventory  shortages,  supply  chain  or  labor  shortages;  significant  volatility  and  disruption  of  global  financial  markets,  which  could  cause  fluctuations  in currency exchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future; illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements. Any of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory actions against us.

## We incur significant expenses in operating our business, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in our artificial intelligence initiatives as well as Reality Labs, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.

We incur significant expenses in operating our business, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market new and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies, including AI and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement. We have previously undertaken cost reduction measures in light of a more challenging operating environment, which may adversely affect these or other business initiatives, and some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-front charges and outlays of cash to reduce certain longer-

<!-- page break -->

term  expenses.  In  addition,  from  time  to  time  we  are  subject  to  settlements,  judgments,  fines,  or  other  monetary  penalties  in  connection  with  legal  and regulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including as part of our metaverse and wearables efforts. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in Reality Labs, have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2024 overall operating profit by approximately $17.73 billion, and we expect our Reality Labs investments and operating losses to increase in 2025. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.

## Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our products and services could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.

Our  reputation  and  ability  to  attract,  retain,  and  serve  our  users  is  dependent  upon  the  reliable  performance  of  our  products  and  services  and  our underlying technical infrastructure. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products and services  from  time  to  time.  Our  systems  may  not  be  adequately  designed  or  may  not  operate  with  the  reliability  and  redundancy  necessary  to  avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products or services are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products or services as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time. In addition, as the amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, especially with the deployment of AI technologies, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure,  including  network  capacity,  computing  power,  and  related  energy  requirements,  to  continue  to  satisfy  our  needs. Although  we  are  making significant investments in our technical infrastructure, it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate  these  increased  demands  or  achieve  our  business  objectives,  which  may  adversely  affect  our  user  engagement  and  advertising  revenue.  In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events and crises. Global climate change could result in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Any  such  events  may  result  in  users  being  subject  to  service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may  adversely  affect  our  financial  results.  We  also  have  been,  and  may  in  the  future  be,  subject  to  increased  energy  and/or  other  costs  to  maintain  the availability or performance of our products and services in connection with any such events.

A substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, various challenges with the supply chain related to supporting our technical infrastructure. As a result, we have adjusted, and may continue to adjust in the future, our procurement practices to adapt to the evolving landscape. We may not be able to secure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.

Any of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products or services, require unfavorable changes to existing products or services, delay the introduction of future products or services, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.

## We have experienced, and could experience in the future, difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.

We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects. The infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in developing regions that expose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance, trade compliance, and political challenges, among others. We have

<!-- page break -->

changed, suspended, and terminated certain of these projects as a result of various factors, and may continue to do so in the future. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects, including due to the availability of components, power or network capacity, or any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of trade disputes or otherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products and services, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. For example, like others in our industry, we rely on certain third-party equipment and components for our technical infrastructure that are manufactured by a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a single region such as Asia. Any of the foregoing delays or disruptions, including actions by governments or geopolitical events such as  international  conflicts,  could  result  in  tariffs,  sanctions,  export  or  import  controls,  and  other  measures  that  restrict  international  trade,  could  reduce  or eliminate the ability of our suppliers, manufacturers, or other third-party providers to continue their operations to manufacture, or limit or eliminate our ability to purchase, key components of our technical infrastructure.

In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may only  become evident after  we  have  started  to  fully  utilize  the  underlying  equipment,  that  could  further  degrade  the  user  experience  or  increase  our  costs. Further, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreign government, or our response to such government action, has resulted, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

## Real or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.

The numbers for our key metrics, which include our DAP and average revenue per person (ARPP), are calculated using internal company data based on the  activity  of  user  accounts. While  these  numbers  are  based  on  what  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  estimates  of  our  user  base  for  the  applicable  period  of measurement,  there  are  inherent  challenges  in  measuring  usage  of  our  products  across  large  online  and  mobile  populations  around  the  world.  The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually  seeking  to  improve  our  estimates  of  our  user  base,  and  such  estimates  may  change  due  to  improvements  or  changes  in  our  methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.

In addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base that have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.

Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore  must  seek  to  attribute  multiple  user  accounts  within  and  across  products  to  individual  people. To  calculate  these  metrics,  we  rely  upon  complex techniques,  algorithms  and  machine  learning  models  that  seek  to  count  the  individual  people  behind  user  accounts,  including  by  matching  multiple  user accounts  within  an  individual  product  and  across  multiple  products  when  we  believe  they  are  attributable  to  a  single  person,  and  counting  such  group  of accounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further below, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally  will  be  approximately  3%  of  our  worldwide  DAP. At  our  scale,  it  is  very  difficult  to  attribute  multiple  user  accounts  within  and  across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary

<!-- page break -->

significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.

To calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).

We  regularly  evaluate  our  Family  metrics  to  estimate  the  percentage  of  our  DAP  consisting  solely  of  "violating"  accounts.  We  define  "violating" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with  Facebook  and  Instagram  accounts  that  appear  to  be  inauthentic  to  the  reviewers,  but  we  have  limited  visibility  into  WhatsApp  user  activity  due  to encryption.  In  addition,  if  we  believe  an  individual  person  has  one  or  more  violating  accounts,  we  do  not  include  such  person  in  our  violating  accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.

Other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in usage  among  younger  users,  this  age  data  may  be  unreliable  because  a  disproportionate  number  of  our  younger  users  register  with  an  inaccurate  age. Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.

Our estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by user location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.

In addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human error. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material

<!-- page break -->

inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.

## We cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our scale.

Our employee headcount and the scale and complexity of our business have increased significantly over time. The scale of our business and breadth of our  products  create  significant  challenges  for  our  management,  operational,  and  financial  resources,  including  managing  multiple  relationships  with  users, marketers, developers, and other third parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the scale and complexity of our business. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial, and management processes and systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our personnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. In addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022 and 2023, we announced several initiatives, including restructurings, employee layoffs, and measures to scale down our office facilities. These efforts also subject us to risks such as greater than anticipated costs, adverse effects on employee retention, and increased difficulty managing the scale and complexity of our business. For example, we could face delays or challenges with product development, other business and strategic initiatives, or legal and regulatory compliance, as well as other disruptions to our operations. As our organization continues to evolve, and we are required to implement and adapt complex organizational management structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. Any of these developments could negatively affect our business, reputation, or financial results.

## We have significant international operations, which subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our financial results.

We have significant international operations. We currently make our Family products available in a total of more than 100 different languages, and we have  offices  or  data  centers  in  approximately  40  different  countries.  We  may  enter  new  international  regions  where  we  have  limited  or  no  experience  in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available  in  certain  regions  due  to  legal  and  regulatory  complexities.  For  example,  several  of  our  products  are  not  generally  available  in  China.  We  also outsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:

- political, social, or economic instability;
- risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety, accessibility, licensing, and infrastructure matters;
- potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities;
- enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards, terms of service, and other policies across different languages and countries;
- fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;
- foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;
- higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;
- enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;
- burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal,

<!-- page break -->

content moderation, data localization, data protection, competition, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;

- reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
- difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely;
- compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and
- geopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and pandemics.

In addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and sanctions, including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties  they  may  seek  to  impose  against  companies  for  violations  of  anti-corruption  laws  or  regulations,  import  and  export  controls,  trade  restrictions, sanctions, and other laws, rules, and regulations.

If  we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our operations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a result of the risks described above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.

## We face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks with respect to our consumer hardware products that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.

We  face  a  number  of  risks  related  to  design,  manufacturing,  and  supply  chain  management  with  respect  to  our  consumer  hardware  products.  For example,  the  consumer  hardware  products  we  sell  from  time  to  time  have  had,  and  in  the  future  may  have,  quality  issues  resulting  from  the  design  or manufacture  of  the  products,  or  from  the  software  used  in  the  products.  Sometimes,  these  issues  may  be  caused  by  components  we  purchase  from  other manufacturers  or  suppliers.  Our  brand  and  financial  results  could  be  adversely  affected  by  any  such  quality  issues,  other  failures  to  meet  our  customers' expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.

We rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to a number of risks. The manufacturing of our consumer hardware products depends on a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a single region such as Asia. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages, strikes or other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such  arrangements  with  them.  The  manufacturing,  distribution,  and  sale  of  our  consumer  hardware  products  also  may  be  negatively  impacted  by macroeconomic  conditions,  geopolitical  challenges,  trade  disputes,  or  other  actions  by  governments  or  non-state  actors  (including  international  conflicts, tariffs, sanctions, export controls, and other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or logistics disruptions.

We also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing  practices  and  standards  on  labor,  trade  compliance,  health  and  safety,  the  environment,  and  business  ethics,  but  we  do  not  control  them  or  their practices and standards and have experienced violations of these requirements from time to time. If any supplier or business partner violates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.

## We face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.

We are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer  hardware  products,  higher  tariffs  that  increase  consumer  prices,  and  other  factors.  The  demand  for  our  products  can  also  change  significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international regions, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.

## We are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We are involved in  numerous  lawsuits,  including  stockholder  derivative  lawsuits  and  putative  class  action  lawsuits,  many  of  which  claim  statutory damages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face additional class action and other lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment, contingent  workers,  activities  on  our  platform,  consumer  protection,  or  product  performance  or  other  claims  related  to  the  use  of  consumer  hardware  and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as  other  alleged  anticompetitive  conduct;  a  former  employee's  allegations  and  release  of  internal  company  documents  beginning  in  September  2021;  the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the subject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged use of biometric technology, our alleged recommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content, information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools, our alleged use of copyright-protected content to train our AI models, and allegations that Facebook and Instagram cause "social media addiction" in users and allegations of violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

There can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.

## We plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.

As  part  of  our  business  strategy,  we  have  made  and  intend  to  continue  to  make  acquisitions  to  add  specialized  employees  and  complementary companies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able  to  find  suitable  acquisition  candidates,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  complete  acquisitions  or  other  strategic  transactions  on  favorable  terms,  or  at  all, including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, we completed our divestiture of Giphy in 2023 following the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority's  order  directing  us  to  divest  Giphy  post-acquisition.  In  addition,  although  we  were  able  to  successfully  complete  the  acquisition  after prevailing in federal court, the FTC sought to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is

<!-- page break -->

no assurance that we will realize expected synergies and potential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic investments.

We may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which has occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness also results in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and  result  in  dilution  to  our  stockholders.  In  addition,  any  acquisitions  or  other  strategic  transactions  we  announce  could  be  viewed  negatively  by  users, marketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.

We may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant additional  expenses  to  our  results  of  operations  and  recording  of  substantial  finite-lived  intangible  assets  on  our  balance  sheet  upon  closing. Any  of  these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

## We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.

The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these processes successfully. We have made, and may in the future make, substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which can result in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.

## We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

Our tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including  the  manner  in  which  we  operate  our  business,  develop,  value,  manage,  protect,  and  use  our  intellectual  property,  and  the  valuations  of  our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject  to  regular  review  and  audit  by  U.S.  federal,  state,  and  foreign  tax  authorities.  Tax  authorities  may  disagree  with  certain  positions  we  have  taken, including  our  methodologies  for  valuing  developed  technology  or  intercompany  arrangements,  and  any  adverse  outcome  of  such  a  review  or  audit  could increase  our  worldwide  effective  tax  rate,  increase  the  amount  of  non-income  taxes  imposed  on  our  business,  and  harm  our  financial  position,  results  of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.

The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.

<!-- page break -->

Our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.

## Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.

Over the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. A number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the OECD's 15% global minimum tax regime. As additional jurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current international tax rules under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing rules to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business. There are ongoing OECD negotiations that contemplate an alternative to these proposals, which may proliferate in the absence of multilateral agreement.

The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.

Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows.  Such  changes  may  also  apply  retroactively  to  our  historical  operations  and  result  in  taxes  greater  than  the  amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.

## Given our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate has in the past varied, and may in the future vary, significantly depending on our stock price.

The  tax  effects  of  the  accounting  for  share-based  compensation  have  in  the  past  impacted,  and  may  in  the  future  impact,  our  effective  tax  rate, sometimes significantly, from period to period. In periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2024, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $3.22 billion and our effective income tax rate by five percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.

## If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.

We review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assets  are  deemed  to  be  impaired,  an  impairment  loss  equal  to  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  amount  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  would  be recognized. We may be required to record a significant  charge  in  our  financial  statements  during  the  period  in  which  any  impairment  of  our  goodwill  or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.

## The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.

We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg and certain other members of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat sports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death. If Mr. Zuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations. The loss of other key personnel, including members of management as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could also disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.

In addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. In particular, we expect  to  continue  to  face  significant  challenges  in  hiring  specialized  technical  personnel,  particularly  senior  engineering  talent,  whether  as  a  result  of competition with other companies or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted.  Our  ability  to  attract,  retain,  and  motivate  employees  may  also  be  adversely  affected  by  stock  price  volatility.  In  addition,  restrictive  immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.

## Our CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.

Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition,  Mr.  Zuckerberg  has  the  ability  to  control  the  management  and  major  strategic  investments  of  our  company  as  a  result  of  his position as our CEO and his ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary  duty  to  our  stockholders  and  must  act  in  good  faith  in  a  manner  he  reasonably  believes  to  be  in  the  best  interests  of  our  stockholders.  As  a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.

## We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases and dividend payments could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.

Although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our Class A common stock. The specific timing and amount of any share repurchases, and the specific timing and amount of any

<!-- page break -->

dividend payments, will depend on prevailing share prices, general economic and market conditions, company performance, and other considerations. We cannot guarantee that the repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The repurchase program and dividend payments could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of this repurchase program or dividend payments may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this repurchase program and dividend payments will diminish our cash reserves.

## There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.

The payment of any cash dividends in the future is subject to continued capital availability, market conditions, applicable laws and agreements, and our board of directors continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. The declaration and payment of any dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time, and there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.

## Risks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement

## Actions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or moderate content on our products in their countries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell or deliver advertising in their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.

Governments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. Hong Kong has passed additional national security legislation in 2024. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.

It is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell or deliver advertising, including in countries where access to  our  consumer-facing  products  may  be  blocked  or  restricted.  For  example,  we  generate  meaningful  revenue  from  a  small  number  of  resellers  serving advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese, United States, or other government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising  revenue,  whether  as  a  result  of  the  trade  dispute  with  the  United  States,  including  any  tariffs  implemented  by  the  United  States  or  China,  in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.

Similarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.

Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data combination, data protection, content, competition, youth, safety, consumer protection, advertising, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content,  integrity,  intellectual  property,  advertising,  marketing,  distribution,  data  security,  data  retention  and  deletion,  data  localization  and  storage,  data disclosure, AI  and  machine  learning,  electronic  contracts  and  other  communications,  competition,  protection  of  minors,  consumer  protection,  civil  rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and regulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.

These U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and  regulations  are  often  uncertain,  particularly  in  the  new  and  rapidly  evolving  industry  in  which  we  operate,  and  may  be  interpreted  and  applied inconsistently  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction  and  inconsistently  with  our  current  policies  and  practices.  For  example,  regulatory  or  legislative  actions  or litigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various ways, including for advertising, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we provide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue.

We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court.

On March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities  (E.O.),  and  on  June  30,  2023,  the  European  Union  and  the  three  additional  countries  making  up  the  EEA  were  designated  by  the  United  States Attorney General as a 'qualifying state' under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the 'Data Privacy Framework List,' maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF replaces  two  prior  adequacy  frameworks  which  were  invalidated  by  the  CJEU.  A  further  invalidation  of  the  EU-U.S.  DPF  by  the  CJEU  could  create considerable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a

number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, we have been managing investigations and lawsuits in India and other jurisdictions regarding the 2021 updates to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta products and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India and an order by the Competition Commission of India, which we are appealing. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.

We have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU,  and  draft  decisions  in  investigations  by  the  IDPC  are  subject  to  review  by  other  European  privacy  regulators  as  part  of  the  GDPR's  consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators  other  than  the  IDPC,  including  where  those  regulators  consider  they  must  act  urgently  or  where  they  believe  their  concerns  relate  only  to  data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations.  In  addition,  Brazil,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  other  countries  have  enacted  similar  data  protection  regulations  imposing  data  privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights  and  controls  for  users  under  18  years  old  and  their  parents  or  guardians.  Like  comprehensive  privacy  laws,  these  laws  are  evolving  and  subject  to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from "legitimate interests" to "consent," and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a "subscription for no ads" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance  with  requirements  under  the  GDPR,  DMA,  and  EU  consumer  laws.  For  example,  in  March  2024,  the  European  Commission  opened  formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our "subscription for no ads" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024.  In  addition,  the  European  Data  Protection  Board  has  published  an  opinion  on  the  operation  of  such  models  under  GDPR  and  European  consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by  ads,  an  option  to  see  less  personalized  ads,  which  are  expected  to  be  less  relevant  and  effective  than  our  premium  ad  offerings.  These  or  any  similar developments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.

Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European Union imposes restrictions and requirements on

<!-- page break -->

companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions  could  have  similar  effects.  Further,  the  DSA,  which  started  to  apply  to  our  business  as  of  August  2023,  imposes  certain  restrictions  and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition,  some  countries,  such  as  the  UK,  India,  and  Turkey,  are  considering  or  have  passed  legislation  implementing  data  protection  requirements,  new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services  or  our  ability  to  offer  products  and  services  to  minors  in  certain  jurisdictions.  For  example,  several  U.S.  states,  including Arkansas,  Utah, Texas, California, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to minors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of existing laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also subject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could subject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third parties in such transactions. In addition, the Province of British Columbia has considered, and may in the future consider, a bill that would permit the government to recover public health-related costs potentially associated with providing goods and services in British Columbia, including potentially social media services.

We are also subject to disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements regarding our social and environmental risks and initiatives. There has been increased focus on these initiatives by many regulators, investors, and other stakeholders and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable federal, state, local or international laws and regulations could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

These laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any government actions, have led to, and may in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, changes to our products, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines, damages, or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.

## We have been and remain subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business.

We receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of which  are  evolving  and  subject  to  interpretation.  We  are  and  expect  to  continue  to  be  the  subject  of  investigations,  inquiries,  data  requests,  requests  for information, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data protection,  including  with  respect  to  processing  of  sensitive  data,  data  from  third  parties,  data  for  advertising  purposes,  data  security,  minors,  data  subject rights,  safety,  law  enforcement,  consumer  protection,  civil  rights,  content  and  content  moderation,  use  of  our  platform  for  illegal,  illicit,  or  otherwise objectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, content, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union, United States, and other jurisdictions have initiated actions,

<!-- page break -->

investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, we have been and continue to be the subject of litigation and investigations related to the ways in which we collect and use information, including where advertisers are subject to additional regulation such as housing, employment, credit, and financial services. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation, and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified consent  order  and  initiated  an  administrative  proceeding  against  us,  which  we  are  challenging  at  the  agency  and  in  federal  court,  that  alleges  deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar  notifications  to  European  regulators  under  other  laws  (such  as  UK  GDPR  and  Member  State  implementations  of  the  ePrivacy  Directive),  and  are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. In addition, we are subject to inquiries and investigations by the European Commission regarding our compliance with various provisions of the DSA relating to the use of Facebook and Instagram,  including  matters  related  to  elections,  content  reporting  and  appeals,  third-party  access  to  data,  political  content  recommendations,  potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, and minors and other vulnerable users. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to penalties, fines, and requirements to change our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, in July 2024, we entered into a settlement to resolve a lawsuit by the state of Texas in connection with the "tag suggestions" feature and other uses of facial recognition technology.

We are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, messaging services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, beginning in 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Beginning in 2020, we became subject to a lawsuit by the FTC alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in November 2024, the European Commission issued a fine as a result of its finding that we tied Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee.

Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.

Compliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.

We  are  engaged  in  ongoing  privacy  compliance  and  oversight  efforts,  including  in  connection  with  our  modified  consent  order  with  the  FTC, requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative

<!-- page break -->

requirements around the world, such as U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, EU AI Act, the Korean Personal Information  Protection Act,  and  the  Indian  Digital  Personal  Data  Protection  Act.  In  particular,  we  are  maintaining  a  comprehensive  privacy  program  in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We continually reallocate resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected. Further,  our  privacy  compliance  and  oversight  efforts  have  required,  and  we  expect  will  continue  to  require,  significant  time  and  attention  from  our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For example, we are subject to restrictions and requirements under the DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services and product design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement.

The FTC initiated an administrative proceeding against us alleging, among other things, deficient compliance with the FTC consent order and seeking substantial modifications to the requirements of the consent order, including a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the  composition  of  our  board  of  directors,  and  significant  limitations  on  our  ability  to  modify  and  launch  new  products.  We  are  challenging  the  FTC's administrative proceeding. If the challenge is unsuccessful and the FTC is able to impose the proposed order in its current form, it would limit our ability to provide certain features and services, engage in certain business practices, require us to further increase the time, resources, and costs we spend on compliance and oversight efforts, and would adversely affect our business and financial results.

If we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order (including any future modifications to the order), GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if any relevant authority believes that we are in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines or damages (including for loss of control of data without other damage), judgments, penalties, or other remedies, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.

## We may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and financial results.

We have faced,  currently  face,  and  will  continue  to  face  claims  and  government  and  regulatory  inquiries  relating  to  information  or  content  that  is published or made available on our products, including claims, inquiries, and investigations relating to our policies, algorithms, and enforcement decisions with respect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, deceptive and fraudulent advertising, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws  regulating  hate  speech  or  other  types  of  content,  on-  or  offline  safety  and  well-being  (such  as  acts  of  violence,  terrorism,  improper  promotion  or distribution  of  pharmaceuticals  and  illicit  drugs,  human  exploitation,  child  exploitation,  illegal  gaming,  and  other  fraudulent  or  otherwise  illegal  activity), products liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. For example, over the last several years we have seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-being issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. In addition, we have been subject to litigation alleging that our ad targeting and delivery practices constitute violations of anti-discrimination laws.

The potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less

<!-- page break -->

protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which the EU member states have since implemented into their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are implementing. Additionally, Brazil has an intermediary liability framework limiting liability for third-party content, which has been challenged as unconstitutional and is under review by the Brazilian Supreme Court. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act  (Section  230)  was  at  issue,  but  it  ultimately  declined  to  address  Section  230  in  its  decision.  There  also  have  been,  and  continue  to  be,  various  other litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, including electoral-related and AI-generated content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.

We could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial or government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or other  penalties  for  failure  to  comply  with  certain  content  removal,  law  enforcement  cooperation,  and  disclosure  obligations.  Numerous  other  countries  in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing liability or potentially significant penalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to fines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products or  business  practices,  increase  our  costs,  or  otherwise  impact  our  operations  or  our  ability  to  provide  services  in  certain  geographies.  For  example,  the European  Copyright  Directive  requires  certain  online  services  to  obtain  authorizations  for  copyrighted  content  or  to  implement  measures  to  prevent  the availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European Copyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services are subject to restrictions and requirements, and we are subject to increased compliance costs, and potential fines or other penalties in the event of non-compliance, as a result of the Digital Services Act in the European Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, and other content-related legislative developments such as the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act in Ireland and the Online Safety Act in the United Kingdom. Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation that may require  us  to  pay  publishers  for  certain  news  content  shared  on  our  products.  For  example,  as  a  result  of  such  legislation  in  Canada,  we  have  ended  the availability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and Instagram. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation or investigations may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement.

Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.

## Payment-related activities may subject us to additional regulatory requirements, regulatory actions, and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business.

Several of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual, and digital goods from merchants and developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among other  activities.  We  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  laws  and  regulations  in  the  United  States,  Europe,  and  elsewhere,  including  those  governing  anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions. In addition, we could become subject to new consumer protection laws and regulations that may be adopted or amended, including those related to payments activity as well as sharing, collection, and use of  payments-related  data.  For  example,  the  CFPB  issued  its  anticipated  Larger  Participant  Rule,  effective  January  2025,  allowing  the  CFPB  to  conduct supervisory activities over general-use digital consumer payment applications. The Rule, which is under legal challenge by a trade association, could subject certain of our payments products to this authority. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. We have received certain

<!-- page break -->

payments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions for our regulated Payments-related products and activities. These licenses  increase  flexibility  in  how  our  use  of  Payments  may  evolve,  help  mitigate  regulatory  uncertainty,  and  will  generally  require  us  to  demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in relation to our regulated Payments products and activities. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and attention and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

In addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion of management time and attention and other resources to address bad transactions or customer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees, or third parties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the future undertake additional payments initiatives, including as part of our metaverse efforts, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.

## Risks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property

## Security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.

Our industry is prone to cyber-attacks by parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service or otherwise harm us. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from users,  or  information  from  marketers,  could  result  in  the  loss,  modification,  disclosure,  destruction,  or  other  misuse  of  such  data,  which  could  harm  our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other illegal,  illicit,  or  otherwise  objectionable  ends. As  a  result  of  our  prominence,  the  size  of  our  user  base,  the  types  and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, statesponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors, and we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience or otherwise adversely affect users, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive, and to prevent or disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; social engineering or other cyber-attacks directed towards our personnel or their access; misuse of company data or systems by our personnel; defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems or offerings; government exploitation or surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities, technical infrastructure, or other equipment; or other threats that evolve. In addition, other parties may attempt to fraudulently or maliciously induce employees, contractors, vendors, or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to reduce the risk of data loss or misuse, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to reduce the risk of or detect security breaches, such measures will not provide absolute security, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to react in a timely manner to any cyber-attacks or other security incidents, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. Our business and operations span numerous geographies around the world and involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties. At any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our security efforts.

In addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with our products.

<!-- page break -->

We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us. However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed.

We regularly  experience  such  cyber-attacks  and  other  security  incidents  of  varying  degrees,  and  we  incur  significant  costs  in  protecting  against  or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, including the GDPR and EU member state laws implementing the EU Cybersecurity Directive (NIS2), as well as obligations under our modified consent  order  with  the  FTC.  As  a  result,  government  authorities,  affected  users,  or  other  parties  could  initiate  legal  or  regulatory  actions  against  us  in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of data, or other cybersecurity issues, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.

## Intentional misuse of our services and user data and other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform could adversely affect our business.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intentional misuse of our services and user data by third parties, as well as other undesirable, illicit, or high-risk activity on our platform. We are making significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review efforts to combat these activities, including investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. We have discovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable or illicit activity by third parties or malfeasant internal actors. We will not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, the allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC, government authorities, the media, or other third parties.

Such incidents and activities include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of hacked, false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising practices, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline (such as acts of violence, terrorism, improper promotion or distribution of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation, child exploitation, and illegal  gaming),  instances  of  spamming,  surveillance,  scraping,  data  harvesting,  unsecured  datasets,  or  spreading  misinformation,  or  other  fraudulent  or otherwise illegal activity. From time to time we are unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. We may also be subject to increased risk as a result of changes to our content policies and enforcement efforts which we began to implement in January 2025 to further free expression on our platform and mitigate over-enforcement of certain of our content policies.

Consequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Such developments have subjected, and may in the future subject, us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.

## Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business.

Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by third parties (including open source software and the operating systems and browsers which users rely on to run our applications and access our systems), that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and  manage  immense  amounts  of  data.  The  software  and  hardware  on  which  we  rely  has  contained,  and  will  in  the  future  contain,  errors,  bugs,  or vulnerabilities,  and  our  systems  are  subject  to  certain  technical  limitations  that  may  compromise  our  ability  to  meet  our  objectives.  Some  errors,  bugs,  or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within

<!-- page break -->

the  software  and  hardware on which we rely, or human error or malfeasance in using such systems, have led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience or other adverse effects for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner  consistent  with  our  terms,  contracts,  or  policies,  delayed  product  introductions  or  enhancements,  targeting,  measurement,  or  billing  errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.

## If  we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.

We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third  parties  with  whom  we  have  relationships,  as  well  as  trademark,  copyright,  patent,  trade  secret,  and  domain  name  protection  laws,  to  protect  our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source and other permissive licenses and have made other technology we developed available under such licenses, and we include open source software in our products. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our AI may be subject to open source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

## We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Companies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various "nonpracticing  entities"  that  own  patents  and  other  intellectual  property  rights  often  attempt  to  aggressively  assert  their  rights  in  order  to  extract  value  from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, or introduce new features for existing products, which could increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and other rights holders.

From time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, trademarks, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and develop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending intellectual property litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us

<!-- page break -->

to change or cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to change or cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices, or branding or discontinue the practices or branding. The development of alternative non-infringing technology, branding or practices could require significant effort and expense, could result in less effective technology, branding or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.

## Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

## The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.

The trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $638.40 through December 31, 2024. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

- actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;
- the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;
- actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
- additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation of such sales;
- investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;
- announcements  by  us  or  our  competitors  of  significant  products  or  features,  technical  innovations,  acquisitions,  strategic  partnerships,  joint ventures, or capital commitments;
- announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or the effectiveness of our ad products;
- changes  in  operating  performance  and  stock  market  valuations  of  technology  companies  in  our  industry,  including  our  developers  and competitors;
- price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;
- the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index;
- media coverage of our business and financial performance;
- lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;
- adverse  government  actions  or  legislative  or  regulatory  developments  relating  to  advertising,  competition,  content,  privacy,  or  other  matters, including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;
- trading activity in our share repurchase program; and

<!-- page break -->

- other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses to these events.

In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.

## The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.

Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of our Class B common stock, including our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.

Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.

## Our status as a "controlled company" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.

Because we qualify as a "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect  not  to  have  a  majority  of  our  board  of  directors  be  independent  or  not  to  have  a  compensation  committee  or  an  independent  nominating  function. Accordingly,  should  the  interests  of  our  controlling  stockholder  differ  from  those  of  other  stockholders,  the  other  stockholders  may  not  have  the  same protections  afforded  to  stockholders  of  companies  that  are  subject  to  all  of  the  corporate  governance  rules  for  Nasdaq-listed  companies.  Our  status  as  a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.

## Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.

Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:

- until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;
- we  currently  have  a  dual  class  common  stock  structure,  which  provides  Mr.  Zuckerberg  with  the  ability  to  control  the  outcome  of  matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;

<!-- page break -->

- when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;
- when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;
- when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;
- when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;
- only our board chair, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;
- advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;
- our  certificate  of  incorporation  authorizes  undesignated  preferred  stock,  the  terms  of  which  may  be  established,  and  shares  of  which  may  be issued, without stockholder approval; and
- certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.

## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

## Item 1C. Cybersecurity

At Meta, cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. Our industry is prone to cybersecurity threats and attacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees. We believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence and scale, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and services reach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. In addition, our business and operations span numerous  geographies  around  the  world,  involve  thousands  of  employees,  contractors,  vendors,  developers,  partners,  and  other  third  parties,  and  rely  on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of policies and controls designed to mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our program. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.

We use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and industry-recognized practices, for  managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure, and corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity threats,  we  evaluate  a  variety  of  developments  including  threat  intelligence,  first-  and  third-party  vulnerabilities,  evolving  regulatory  requirements,  and observed cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes in addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify areas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts and consultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as benchmarking against industry practices. However, we may not be successful in fully  addressing  such  areas  for  remediation  or  enhancement.  In  addition,  we  maintain  a  privacy  risk  management program to assess privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user data, which is subject to assessment by an independent, thirdparty privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent assessment and assurance on the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy programs and the supporting control frameworks. These processes

<!-- page break -->

support informed risk-based decision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity countermeasures and risk mitigation strategies. Our risk mitigation strategies include a broad variety of technical and operational measures, as well as annual cybersecurity and privacy training for all of our employees.

In addition, we maintain specific policies and practices governing our third-party security risks, including our third-party assessment (TPA) process. Under our TPA process, we gather information from certain third parties who contract with Meta and share or receive data, or have access to or integrate with our systems, in order to help us assess potential risks associated with their security controls. We also generally require third parties to, among other things, maintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of material data breaches that may impact our data.

Our board of directors has oversight of our strategic and business risk management and has delegated cybersecurity risk management oversight to the audit &amp; risk oversight committee of our board of directors (Audit &amp; Risk Oversight Committee). Our Audit &amp; Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for ensuring that management has processes in place designed to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the company is exposed and to implement processes and programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The privacy &amp; product compliance committee of our board of directors (Privacy &amp; Product Compliance Committee) oversees risks related to privacy and data use, including overseeing compliance with our comprehensive privacy program. Management is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures, maintaining cybersecurity policies and procedures, and providing regular reports to our board of directors, including through the Audit &amp; Risk Oversight Committee and Privacy &amp; Product Compliance Committee.

Our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Guy Rosen, leads our cybersecurity program and oversees teams across the company supporting our security functions of identify, prevent, detect, respond, and recover. These teams are comprised of personnel with a broad range of experience across the private and public sectors, the technology industry, and different geographic regions. Mr. Rosen has two decades of experience in various cybersecurity, software development, product management, and other technology-related roles. Mr. Rosen has served in a number of significant leadership roles at our company since 2013, including oversight of security, safety, and integrity initiatives, and was appointed as our CISO in 2022. Prior to joining our company, Mr. Rosen served in senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles across technology organizations.

Our cybersecurity teams monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through a variety of technical and operational measures, and regularly report to our CISO. Our CISO is part of the senior management team at the company and regularly updates the Audit &amp; Risk Oversight Committee on the company's cybersecurity program, including cybersecurity risks, incidents, and mitigation strategies.

In 2024, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not experienced undetected cybersecurity incidents. For additional information about these risks, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Item 2. Properties

Our corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2024, we owned and leased approximately 11 million square feet of office and building space for our corporate headquarters and in the surrounding areas, which included approximately two million square feet of unoccupied office and building space that we plan to either sublease, early terminate, or abandon related to our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. We also owned and leased approximately 62 acres of land to be developed to accommodate anticipated future growth.

In addition, we have offices in more than 90 cities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. We own 27 data center locations globally and we also lease some data centers at selected locations.

We believe that our facilities, which are used by both reportable segments, are adequate for our current needs.

## Item 3. Legal Proceedings

As  a  multinational  company  with  a  complex  and  evolving  business,  we  are,  and  expect  to  continue  to  be,  subject  to  numerous  claims,  litigation, regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal proceedings in jurisdictions around the world. Although we believe many of these matters are without merit and are vigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved adversely or we  may  be  subject  to  an  unfavorable  judgment  that  may  not  be  reversed  upon  appeal.  We  may  also  decide  to  settle  litigation,  disputes,  or  other  legal proceedings in some instances on terms that are unfavorable to us. In addition, we may become subject to orders or consent decrees imposed by government or regulatory authorities. Any such developments could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time  and  attention  of  management  from  our  business,  or  subject  us  to  other  structural  or  behavioral  remedies  that  adversely  affect  our  business. We  have experienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the past, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in light of complex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and advertiser base.

Over the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving the company have increased, and there can be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are facing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid or limit the application of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims and certain of those matters have survived motions to dismiss, including through the use of products liability theories. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new regulatory regimes, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, EU AI Act and similar statutes in non-EU countries such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act, and new fining guidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are facing inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance, as well as private litigation in Europe, including class and mass actions, claiming damages (including for loss of control of  data  without  other  damage)  and/or  injunctions  in  respect  of  alleged  failings  to  comply  with  such  regulatory  requirements.  We  are  also  responding  to litigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing or contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health and  safety  impacts  on  users,  particularly  younger  users,  child  and  adult  sexual  exploitation,  illegal  activity  with  respect  to  drugs,  fraud,  unlawful discrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people. This is in addition to significant tax, competition and antitrust, stockholder, commercial, consumer, and privacy litigation and investigations. Furthermore, as the number of our users and amount of our revenue have grown, our potential exposure to substantial damages awards and fines has increased.

In some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have not previously been enforced, or where the nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be very difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the nature and extent of injunctive or other non-monetary relief and the applicability and amount of any potential forfeitures, disgorgement, fines or penalties. While we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material, there can be no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our activities will not result from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.

## Privacy and Related Matters

Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re Facebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors appealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state

<!-- page break -->

attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation .  On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.

On May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v. Facebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The underlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to rule.

On November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the district court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss our complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy ( Jarkesy ). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending appeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy . Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The district court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to dismiss.

On April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the Order to Show Cause proceeding was legally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners on  those  issues  on  November  12,  2024.  On  January  10,  2025,  the  Commission  issued  a  decision  on  certain  threshold  legal  issues,  including  that  the Commission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta's jurisdictional challenges currently pending  before  the  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit  in U.S.  v.  Facebook,  Inc. ,  and  that  the  nature  and  scope  of  any  further administrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.

We also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under

<!-- page break -->

other laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other  European  regulators  regarding  various  aspects  of  our  regulatory  compliance.  For  example,  the  IDPC  is  continuing  to  assess  the  compliance  of  our "subscription for no ads" consent model with requirements under the GDPR. In addition, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a "qualifying state" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the "Data Privacy Framework List," maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome  milestones,  and  we  have  implemented  steps  to  comply  with  the  above  corrective  orders  following  engagement  with  the  IDPC.  For  additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data combination, data protection, content, competition, youth, safety, consumer protection, advertising, e-commerce, and other matters" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceedings) could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.

Beginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals' information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief (for example, In re Meta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor, Inc. et al.; Doe v. GoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the Santa Clara County Superior Court). These cases are in different stages, but several of our motions to dismiss have been denied in whole or in part, while certain others have been granted in whole or in part. We are currently in discovery and litigating class certification in the cases that are most advanced.

## Competition

We are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe,  and  other  jurisdictions.  Such  investigations,  inquiries,  and  lawsuits  concern,  among  other  things,  our  business  practices  in  the  areas  of  social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in 2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint ( FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. On April 5, 2024, we filed our motion for summary judgment and the FTC filed its opposition and its own motion for partial summary judgment on May 24, 2024. On November 13, 2024, the court granted in part and denied in part both our and the FTC's motions for summary judgment. Trial is set to begin on April 14, 2025. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the  cases  brought  on  behalf  of  certain  advertisers  and  users  in  the  United  States  were  consolidated  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of California ( Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our

<!-- page break -->

motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 30, 2024, we filed our motion for summary judgment in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.

In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102 on the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union in relation to certain alleged business practices relating to Facebook Marketplace and imposed a fine of approximately EUR €798 million. We appealed the European Commission's decision on January 28, 2025.

In  March  2024,  the  European  Commission  opened  an  investigation  into  the  compliance  of  our  "subscription  for  no  ads"  consent  model  with requirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act. The European Commission issued preliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.

The result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.

## Securities and Other Actions

Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case. We filed a petition for writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit's order. The Supreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10, 2024, and following oral argument issued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.

We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages ( Ohio Pub. Empl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc .). On September 30, 2024, the court dismissed certain claims with leave to amend, but determined certain claims regarding content enforcement practices and user well-being could proceed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers.

On March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified damages ( Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On July 18, 2023, the court dismissed the claims against Meta and its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and on September 17, 2024, the court dismissed the claims with prejudice. On October 14, 2024, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal.

<!-- page break -->

## Youth-Related Actions

Beginning  in  January  2022,  we  became  subject  to  litigation  and  other  proceedings  that  were  filed  in  various  federal  and  state  courts  alleging  that Facebook and Instagram cause "social media addiction" in users, with most proceedings focused on those under 18 years old, resulting in various mental health and other harms. Putative class actions have been filed in the United States, Brazil, and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school districts,  municipalities,  and  tribal  nations  have  filed  public  nuisance  claims  in  the  United  States,  Brazil,  and/or  Canada  based  on  similar  allegations.  On October 6, 2022, the U.S. federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In  re  Social  Media Adolescent Addiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation ). Beginning in March 2023, U.S. states and territories began filing lawsuits on these topics in various federal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child sexual abuse material and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business practices, public nuisance, and products liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices (including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years old. These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country. Beginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to "social media addiction" and related harms allegedly caused by Instagram.

We are  also  subject  to  government  investigations  and  requests  from  multiple  regulators  in  various  jurisdictions  globally  concerning  the  use  of  our products and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA), including the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and other vulnerable users that may stem from the design and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.

## Other Actions

Beginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( DZ Reserve v. Facebook, Inc. )  and  seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court dismissed  certain  of  the  plaintiffs'  claims,  but  permitted  their  fraud  and  unfair  competition  claims  to  proceed.  On  March  29,  2022,  the  court  granted  the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the order granting class certification. On May 3, 2024, we filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was denied by the Ninth Circuit. We filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 2, 2024, which was denied.

Beginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Farnsworth v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ( Huckabee, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al. , which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) alleging that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. These cases have all been consolidated into Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc .

In the first quarter of 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Vivek H. Murthy, Surgeon General, et al. v. Missouri, et al. , on the question of whether  federal  government  officials  violated  the  First Amendment  in  their  communications  with  the  company  and  others  related  to  content  moderation practices, and heard argument in Netchoice, et al. v. Paxton and Moody, et al. v. Netchoice et al. , regarding the application of the First Amendment relating to content moderation on tech platforms. As to Murthy ,  a  majority of the Supreme Court decided the case on plaintiffs' standing, declining to rule on the First Amendment questions, and sending the case back down to the lower courts where the case continues. As  to NetChoice ,  the  Supreme  Court  unanimously vacated the intermediate appellate court decisions, remanding the cases back to the lower courts. Although we are not a party in these actions, the ultimate resolution of the lawsuits and similar others still pending in the federal courts could impact our business.

<!-- page break -->

On April  30,  2024,  the  European  Commission  opened  formal  proceedings  against  us  to  assess  Facebook  and  Instagram's  compliance  with  certain requirements under Articles 14, 16, 17, 20, 24, 25, 34, 35, and 40 of the DSA, regarding a range of topics including elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, including the way in which we identified, assessed,  and  mitigated  against  certain  systemic  risks  on  Instagram  and  Facebook. We  are  also  responding  to  regulatory  inquiries  and  litigation  related  to allegedly deceptive advertising, including but not limited to financial scams, in other parts of the world.

On September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise (NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products and services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the Director of the CFPB that the Bureau take legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged receipt and use for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as well as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided us with an opportunity to respond. We disagree with the claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded through the NORA process. The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action against us, the CFPB could file a lawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief.

In addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our  obligation  to  disclose  user  information  in  particular  circumstances. A  number  of  such  instances  have  resulted  in  the  assessment  of  fines  and  penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.

We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we expect to be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes in the future.

Beginning in February 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share to the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2024 under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was most recently amended in May 2024, are entitled to dividend equivalent rights. During the year ended December 31, 2024, total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $4.38 billion and $691 million for Class A and Class B common stock, respectively.

Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs.

See  Note  13  -  Stockholders'  Equity  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  "Financial  Statements  and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding dividends.

## Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated  financial  information,  the  following  discussion  contains  forward-looking  statements  that  reflect  our  plans,  estimates,  and  beliefs.  Our  actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of our Family metrics, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled " -Revenue -Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue." To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2024 using 2023 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled " -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Free Cash Flow."

These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.

## Executive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results

Our mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.

Our financial results and key Family metrics for 2024 are set forth below. Total revenue for 2024 was $164.50 billion, an increase of 22% compared to 2023, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23% compared to 2023. Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in 2024 increased 11% year-over-year, and our average price per ad increased 10% year-over-year.

Income from operations for 2024 was $69.38 billion, an increase of $22.63 billion, or 48%, compared to 2023, driven by an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs.

- Average price per ad increased by 10% year-over-year in 2024.

## Developments in Advertising

Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as  a  result  of  limitations  on  our  ad  targeting  and  measurement  tools  arising  from  changes  to  the  regulatory  environment  and  third-party  mobile  operating systems and browsers.

In  particular,  legislative  and  regulatory  developments  such  as  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation,  including  its  evolving  interpretation  through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, European Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and an increasing

<!-- page break -->

number of laws have been introduced limiting or prohibiting the provision of our services to younger users. We expect these and other developments will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads and may negatively impact our advertising revenue and user engagement. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from "legitimate interests" to "consent," and began offering users in the region a "subscription for no ads" alternative. We subsequently began offering users in the region who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced  future  plans  to  limit  the  ability  of  websites  and  application  developers  to  collect  and  use  these  signals  to  target  and  measure  advertising.  For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.

To mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are developing  privacy  enhancing  technologies  to  deliver  relevant  ads  and  measurement  capabilities  while  reducing  the  amount  of  personal  information  we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery, targeting,  and  measurement  capabilities.  Further,  we  are  focused  on  driving  onsite  conversions  in  our  business  messaging  ad  products  by  developing  new features and scaling existing features.

We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising  purposes.  We  believe  our  ongoing  improvements  to  ad  targeting  and  measurement  are  continuing  to  drive  improved  results  for  advertisers. However, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.

In addition, we maintain advertising policies to protect the security and integrity of our platform and comply with global content, security, and integrity obligations. Our ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement against ads and marketers which violate our advertising policies adversely affect our revenue, and we expect that the continued enhancement of such efforts will have an impact on our revenue in the future, which may be material.

## Other Business and Macroeconomic Conditions

Other global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation,  high  interest  rates,  and  related  market  uncertainty,  which  has  led  to  reduced  marketer  spending.  While  we  saw  improvement  in  business  and macroeconomic  conditions  in  recent  periods,  continued  business,  macroeconomic,  and  geopolitical  uncertainty  remains,  which  could  impact  our  financial results in future periods.

In addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. However, we continue to face competition from other products and services within certain demographics, in particular younger users. In addition, while Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more regions from time to time due to geopolitical conditions, which have adversely affected our user growth and engagement. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in 2024, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.

<!-- page break -->

Although we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.

## Investment Philosophy

We expect  to  continue  to  build  on  the  discipline  and  habits  that  we  developed  in  2022  when  we  initiated  several  efforts  to  increase  our  operating efficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount.

We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products that may only be fully realized in the next decade. In 2024, our RL segment reduced our overall operating profit by approximately $17.73 billion, and we continue to expect our RL operating losses to increase in 2025. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our RL efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.

## Trends in Our Revenue by User Geography

We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results. Our revenue in regions such as United  States  &amp;  Canada  and  Europe  is  relatively  higher  primarily  due  to  the  size  and  maturity  of  those  online  and  mobile  advertising  markets,  and  ad impression growth is primarily in geographies that monetize at lower rates, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. In 2024, revenue increased by 18% in United States &amp; Canada, 26% in Europe, 22% in Asia-Pacific, and 31% in Rest of World, in each case relative to 2023.

<!-- image -->

Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.

Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 - Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers.

## Trends in Our Family Metrics

The numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP based on their other activities on our Family products.

Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.

- Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively,  our  "Family"  of  products)  who  visited  at  least  one  of  these  Family  products  through  a  mobile  device  application  or  using  a  web  or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques,  algorithms,  and  machine  learning  models  that  seek  to  estimate  the  underlying  number  of  unique  people  using  one  or  more  of  these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP as a measure of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Note: We report the numbers of DAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, our Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.

Worldwide DAP increased 5% to 3.35 billion on average during December 2024 from 3.19 billion during December 2023.

Note: We updated our definition of ARPP beginning in the first quarter of 2024 and have recast ARPP in prior periods for comparative purposes.

Our annual worldwide ARPP in 2024, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $49.63, an increase of 15% from 2023.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis,  we  evaluate  our  accounting  estimates  based  on  historical  experience  and  on  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  are  reasonable  under  the circumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

An accounting estimate is considered critical  if  both  (i)  the  nature  of  the  estimates  or  assumptions  is  material  due  to  the  levels  of  subjectivity  and judgment  involved,  and  (ii)  the  impact  within  a  reasonable  range  of  outcomes  of  the  estimates  and  assumptions  is  material  to  our  consolidated  financial statements. We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Loss Contingencies

We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors,  in  particular,  have  resulted  in  significant  changes  to  these  estimates  and  judgments  in  prior  quarters  based  on  updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against  us.  In  addition,  certain  government  inquiries  and  investigations,  such  as  matters  before  our  lead  European  Union  privacy  regulator,  the  Irish  Data Protection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in the future.

The ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts that materially differ from management's estimates of losses, it could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. See Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.

## Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our actual and forecasted income (loss) before

<!-- page break -->

provision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to recognize our net deferred tax assets.

We recognize tax  benefits  from  uncertain  tax  positions  only  if  we  believe  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  tax  position  will  be  sustained  on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates related to uncertainties with our research and development tax credits that are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Similarly, our estimates for transfer pricing have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.

## Valuation of Assets

The valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of future cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.

Impairment  testing  for  long-lived-assets,  including  property  and  equipment  and  operating  lease  right-of-use  assets,  occurs  whenever  events  or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to  generate  from  the  use  and  eventual  disposition. The  impairment  test  is  performed  at  the  asset  group  level  for  which  identifiable  cash  flows  are  largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.

Impairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative is performed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited  to,  the  investee's  financial  condition  and  business  outlook;  industry  and  sector  performance;  regulatory,  economic  or  technological  environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value  of  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  using  the  market  approach  and/or  the  income  approach  and  recognize  impairment  loss  in  our  consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments  to  the  observable  price  for  differences  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  rights  and  obligations,  control  premium,  liquidity,  or  principal  or  most advantageous markets. The identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.

## Change in Accounting Estimate

In January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full-year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. For information regarding the change in useful lives of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Components of Results of Operations

## Revenue

## Family of Apps (FoA)

Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram,  Messenger,  and  third-party  mobile  applications.  Marketers  pay  for  ad  products  either  directly  or  through  their  relationships  with  advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.

We  recognize  revenue  from  the  display  of  impression-based  ads  in  the  contracted  period  in  which  the  impressions  are  delivered.  Impressions  are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action  the  marketer  contracted  for.  The  number  of  ads  we  show  is  subject  to  methodological  changes  as  we  continue  to  evolve  our  ads  business  and  the structure of our ads products. In particular, the ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are not currently monetized at the same rate as our Feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price paid  per  ad  by  a  marketer  regardless  of  their  desired  objective  such  as  impression  or  action.  For  advertising  revenue  arrangements  where  we  are  not  the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.

Other revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.

## Reality Labs (RL)

RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and content.

## Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses

Cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related  to  the  operation  of  our  data  centers  and  technical  infrastructure,  such  as  depreciation  expense  from  servers,  network  infrastructure  and  buildings, employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also consists of costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.

Research  and  development. Research  and  development  expenses  consist  mostly  of  employee  compensation  which  includes  payroll,  share-based compensation and benefits for our employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new technologies and products; RL technology development costs; infrastructure costs; and facilities-related costs.

Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits  for  our  employees  engaged  in  sales,  sales  support,  marketing,  business  development,  and  customer  service  functions;  marketing  and  promotional expenses; and professional services to support our community and product operations.

General  and  administrative. General  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  employee  compensation  which  includes  payroll,  share-based compensation  and  benefits  for  certain  of  our  executives  as  well  as  our  legal,  finance,  human  resources,  corporate  communications  and  policy,  and  other administrative employees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legal fees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes and other non-income-based tax levies; and professional services.

## Family of Apps

FoA revenue in 2024 increased $29.35 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023. The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.

## Advertising

Advertising revenue in 2024 increased $28.68 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023 due to increases in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad. In 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 11%, as compared with a 28% increase in 2023, year-over-year. Ad impressions delivered during 2024 grew in all regions, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, which was mostly driven by increases in users and their engagement on our products. In 2024, the average price per ad increased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of 9% in 2023, year-over-year. The increase in average price per ad in 2024 was driven by an increase in advertising demand, which we believe is mainly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement tools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled "-Executive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results." In addition, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to the increase in advertising revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and ad impressions delivered.

## Other revenue

FoA other revenue in 2024 increased $664 million, or 63%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by WhatsApp Business Platform revenue.

## Reality Labs

RL revenue in 2024 increased $250 million, or 13%, compared to 2023. The increase was mostly due to an increase in RL consumer hardware products sold.

## Revenue Seasonality

Revenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 19%, 17%, and 16% between the third and fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022 declined 9%, 11%, and 17% compared to the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

## Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue

Changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the full year 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Using these constant rates for full year 2024, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $165.37 billion and $161.51 billion, which were $874 million and $880 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively.

Cost of revenue in 2024 increased $4.20 billion, or 16%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, mostly from higher depreciation expense.

See Note 7 - Property and Equipment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding depreciation expense.

Research and development expenses in 2024 increased $5.39 billion, or 14%, compared to 2023. The increase was mostly due to higher employee compensation as well as infrastructure costs for research and development, partially offset by lower restructuring charges.

The higher  employee  compensation  was  mainly  from  a  13%  growth  in  employee  headcount  from  2023  to  2024  in  engineering  and  other  technical functions supporting our continued investment in our family of products and Reality Labs.

See Note 3 - Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding restructuring charges.

General and administrative expenses in 2024 decreased $1.67 billion, or 15%, compared to 2023. The decrease was mostly driven by a favorable impact of $1.55 billion in legal-related costs. To a lesser extent, the decrease was also attributed to lower restructuring charges, partially offset by an increase in other taxes.

## Family of Apps

FoA income from operations in 2024 increased $24.24 billion, or 39%, compared to 2023. The increase in FoA income from operations was driven by higher advertising revenue which was partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, mostly from higher depreciation expense and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs.

## Reality Labs

RL loss from operations in 2024 increased $1.61 billion, or 10%, compared to 2023, driven by an increase in RL costs and expenses. RL costs and expenses increased primarily due to increases in employee compensation and infrastructure costs.

NM    - not meaningful

Interest  and  other  income  (expense),  net  in  2024  increased  $606  million  compared  to  2023,  mostly  due  to  an  increase  in  interest  income  from  a combination of higher balances and interest rates, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on our long-term debt.

Our provision for income taxes in 2024 decreased $27 million compared to 2023, due to a decrease in the effective tax rate, offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes.

Our effective tax rate in 2024 decreased compared to 2023, primarily due to excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation and an increase in research tax credits.

Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects from capital losses not expected to be utilized, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.

The  accounting  for  share-based  compensation  may  increase  or  decrease  our  effective  tax  rate  based  upon  the  difference  between  our  share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 24, 2025 price, and absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in the range  of  12-15%.  This  includes  the  effects  of  the  mandatory  capitalization  and  amortization  of  research  and  development  expenses  incurred  in  2024,  as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2024 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2025 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be lower.

A number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's 15% global minimum tax regime with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2024. We continue to evaluate  the  impacts  of  proposed  and  enacted  legislation  with  respect  to  the  global  minimum  tax  regime  in  the  jurisdictions  we  operate  in. As  additional jurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.

<!-- page break -->

Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2024, we had net uncertain tax positions of $9.99 billion which was included in long-term income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties with our research tax credits and transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months.

See Note 15 - Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, investment grade corporate debt securities, and marketable equity securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $77.81 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $12.41 billion from December 31, 2023. The increase was due to $91.33 billion of cash generated from operations and $10.43 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in August 2024. These increases were offset by $39.23 billion of capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, our capital returns of $35.20 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and payments of dividends and dividend equivalents,  and  $13.77  billion  of  taxes  paid  related  to  net  share  settlement  of  employee  restricted  stock  unit  (RSU) awards.

The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):

|                                           | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |

| Net cash used in investing activities     | $ (47,150)                | $ (24,495)                | $ (28,970)                |
| Net cash used in financing activities     | $ (40,781)                | $ (19,500)                | $ (22,136)                |

## Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Cash  provided  by  operating  activities  during  2024  mostly  consisted  of  $62.36  billion  net  income  adjusted  for  certain  non-cash  items,  such  as $16.69 billion of share-based compensation expense and $15.50 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2024 compared to 2023, was due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by higher cash paid for income taxes and other operational spending.

## Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $37.26 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, and $9.75 billion of net purchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2024 compared to 2023 was mostly due to increases in net purchases of marketable debt securities and property and equipment.

We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025 to support our core business and generative AI efforts.

<!-- page break -->

## Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $30.13 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $5.07 billion of payments of  dividends  and  dividend  equivalents,  and  $13.77  billion  of  taxes  paid  related  to  net  share  settlement  of  RSUs,  partially  offset  by  $10.43  billion  of  net proceeds from the issuance of additional Notes in August 2024. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2024 compared to 2023, was mostly due to increases in our capital returns of $10.35 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $5.07 billion for quarterly dividend payments that began in March 2024, as well as a $6.76 billion increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.

## Free Cash Flow

In addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as a non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.

We believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.

We have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior management and board of directors.

FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:

- FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and
- other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.

The following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):

|                                           | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |

| Free cash flow                            | $ 52,103                  | $ 43,010                  | $ 18,439                  |

## Material Cash Requirements

We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our investments in infrastructure and AI initiatives, share repurchases and dividend payments for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.

## Leases and Contractual Commitments

Our operating lease obligations mostly include data centers, offices and colocations. Our finance lease obligations include certain network infrastructure. Our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts did not materially change our operating lease obligations. Our contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers and network infrastructure, and content costs from content providers whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform.

## Long-term Debt

As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion, which  mature  from  2027  through  2064.  Short-term  and  long-term  future  interest  payments  obligations  as  of  December  31,  2024  were  $1.39  billion  and $28.10 billion, respectively.

## Capital Return Program

## Share Repurchase

Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 65 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $29.75 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $51.28 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.

## Dividend

We paid four quarterly cash dividends, including dividend equivalents, totaling $2.00 for each share of Class A and Class B common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. Total dividends and dividend equivalents paid were $5.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend and dividend equivalents on our outstanding common stock.

## Taxes

Cash paid for income taxes was $10.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had taxes payable of $718 million related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, which is due within one year.

Our long-term income taxes include $9.99 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.

## Loss Contingencies

We  are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  tax  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations.  Significant  judgment  is  required  to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are  beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity price risk.

## Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange  risk.  It  is  difficult  to  predict  the  effect  hedging  activities  would  have  on  our  results  of  operations.  Foreign  currency  exchange  net  losses  of $690 million, $366 million, and $81 million were recognized in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

## Interest Rate Sensitivity

Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.

Our  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  marketable  debt  securities  consist  of  cash,  time  deposits,  money  market  funds,  U.S.  government  securities,  U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $680 million and $355 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we also had aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate senior notes (the Notes) outstanding of $29.0 billion and $18.50 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.

## Equity Price Risk

Our equity investments include marketable and non-marketable equity securities subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the fair  value  or  carrying  value  of  our  holdings.  Our  marketable  equity  securities  are  publicly  traded  stocks  and  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values.

<!-- page break -->

We record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values, of which publicly traded stocks are subject to market price volatility and represent $1.23 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2024. A hypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $123 million. We did not hold any marketable equity securities as of December 31, 2023.

We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted  for  changes  in  fair  value  resulting  from  observable  transactions  for  identical  or  similar  securities  of  the  same  issuer.  We  perform  a  qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the valuation of the companies we invest in and, therefore, result in a material impairment or downward adjustment in our investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities, which mostly consists of our investment in Jio Platforms Limited, had a carrying value of $6.07 billion and $6.14 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

For additional information, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 - Financial Instruments, Note 6 - Non-marketable Equity Securities, and Note 10 - Long-term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Meta  Platforms,  Inc.  (the  Company)  as  of  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  the  related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 29, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's  financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit &amp; Risk Oversight Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

## Description of the Matter

## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

## Loss Contingencies

As described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in some of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When applicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for certain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of such losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Auditing  the  Company's  accounting  for,  and  disclosure  of  these  loss  contingencies  was  especially  challenging  due  to  the significant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments of the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potential amount or range of such losses.

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the Company's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized and their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of possible losses.

Our audit procedures included reading the minutes or a summary of the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, reading  the  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations,  or  summaries  as  we  deemed appropriate, requesting and receiving internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, meeting with internal and external legal counsel to discuss the nature of the various matters, and obtaining representations from management. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received certain notices from the Internal Revenue  Service  (IRS)  related  to  transfer  pricing  agreements  with  the  Company's  foreign  subsidiaries  for  certain  periods examined. The IRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years subsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in its  position,  it  could  result  in  an  additional  federal  tax  liability,  plus  interest  and  any  penalties  asserted.  The  Company  uses judgment to (1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.

Auditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these uncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the significant  judgment  required  to  assess  management's  evaluation  of  technical  merits  and  the  measurement  of  the  tax  position based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to assess the technical merits of tax positions related to these transfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax positions.

As part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for these positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist with  our  assessment  of  the  technical  merits  of  the  Company's  tax  positions.  This  included  assessing  the  Company's correspondence  with  the  relevant  tax  authorities,  evaluating  income  tax  opinions  or  other  third-party  advice  obtained  by  the Company,  and  requesting  and  receiving  confirmation  letters  from  third-party  advisors.  We  also  used  our  knowledge  of,  and experience with, the application of international and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company's accounting for those tax positions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to determine the amount of the  federal  tax  liability  recognized  and  tested  the  mathematical  accuracy  of  the  underlying  data  and  calculations.  We  also evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in relation to these matters.

## Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated  Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the  consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated January 29, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  our  audit.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our  audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  and evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## META PLATFORMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Organization and Description of Business

We were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.

We report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The segment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our chief executive officer (CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.

## Basis of Presentation

We prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

## Balance Sheets Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts on the consolidated balance sheets have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

- Intangible assets, net was reclassified into other assets
- Partners payable was reclassified into accrued expenses and other current liabilities
- Long-term income taxes was reclassified out of other liabilities

These reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported total assets, total liabilities, revenue, income from operations, net income or cash flows.

## Use of Estimates

Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and  liabilities,  which  are  not  readily  apparent  from  other  sources.  We  base  our  estimates  and  judgments  on  historical  information  and  on  various  other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited  to,  those  related  to  loss  contingencies,  income  taxes,  valuation  of  long-lived  assets  and  their  associated  estimated  useful  lives,  valuation  of  nonmarketable equity securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, and fair value of financial instruments and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

In January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, and determined we should extend the estimated useful lives to 5.5 years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2025.

## Revenue Recognition

We recognize  revenue  under Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC) 606  Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers .  Revenue  is  recognized  when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.

Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded  within  marketing  and  sales  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  income.  We  do  not  disclose  the  value  of  unsatisfied  performance  obligations  for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

Revenue includes sales and usage-based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass-through agent.

## Advertising Revenue

Advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users.

We  recognize  revenue  from  the  display  of  impression-based  ads  in  the  contracted  period  in  which  the  impressions  are  delivered.  Impressions  are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers.

For revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.

We may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cashbased incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration for the reported periods.

## Reality Labs Revenue

RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and content. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.

## Other Revenue

FoA other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.

## Cost of Revenue

Our cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the operation  of  our  data  centers  and  technical  infrastructure,  such  as  depreciation  expense  from  servers,  network  infrastructure  and  buildings,  employee compensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also consists of costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content costs.

<!-- page break -->

## Content Costs

Our content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.

For licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Expensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.

## Software Development Costs

Software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.

Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.

## Share-based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

## Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.

We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all  available  evidence,  both  positive  and  negative,  including  historical  levels  of  income,  expectations  and  risks  associated  with  estimates  of  future  taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.

We recognize tax  benefits  from  uncertain  tax  positions  only  if  we  believe  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  tax  position  will  be  sustained  on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.

## Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

## Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with financial institutions globally and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. We classify amounts in transit from customer credit cards and payment service providers as cash on our consolidated balance sheets.

We hold investments in marketable debt securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate  debt  securities.  We  classify  our  marketable  debt  securities  as  available-for-sale  (AFS)  investments  in  our  current  assets  because  they  represent investments of cash available for current operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.

We also hold investments in marketable equity securities that are publicly traded stocks. We classify these equity securities as marketable securities within current assets on our consolidated balance sheets because they are available to be converted into cash to fund current operations without any restriction. These marketable equity securities are measured at fair value at each reporting date with the resulted unrealized gains and losses recognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.

We classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting mostly of cash related to insurance policies, cash reserves designated for a specific purpose, as well as retention and indemnification holdback for our acquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, based upon the expected duration of the restrictions.

## Non-marketable Equity Securities

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value  resulting  from  observable  transactions  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer  as  of  the  respective  transaction  dates.  We  periodically review our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. When indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below its carrying amount, we write  down  the  investment  to  fair  value.  The  change  in  carrying  value,  resulted  from  the  remeasurements,  is  recognized  in  interest  and  other  income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. For additional information, see Note 6 - Non-marketable Equity Securities.

In addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

## Fair Value Measurements

We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required  to  be  recorded  at  fair  value,  we  consider  the  principal  or  most  advantageous  market  in  which  we  would  transact  and  the  market-based  risk measurements  or  assumptions  that  market  participants  would  use  in  pricing  the  asset  or  liability,  such  as  risks  inherent  in  valuation  techniques,  transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

<!-- page break -->

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair values are derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.

Our  non-marketable  equity  securities  accounted  for  using  the  measurement  alternative  are  recorded  at  fair  value  on  a  non-recurring  basis.  When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.

## Accounts Receivable and Allowances

Accounts  receivable  are  recorded  and  carried  at  the  original  invoiced  amount  less  an  allowance  for  any  potential  uncollectible  amounts.  We  make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various  factors,  including  historical  experience,  the  age  of  the  accounts  receivable  balances,  credit  quality  of  our  customers,  current  economic  conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable were not material.

## Property and Equipment

Property and equipment, including finance leases, are depreciated and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.

The estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets as of December 31, 2024 are described below:

| Property and Equipment            | Useful Life/ Amortization period                        |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Servers and network assets        | Four to Five years (1)                                  |
| Buildings                         | 25 to 30 years                                          |
| Equipment and other               | One to 25 years                                         |
| Finance lease right-of-use assets | Five to 20 years                                        |
| Leasehold improvements            | Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(1) Effective January 2025, the useful lives of certain servers and network assets are extended to 5.5 years.

We evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized.

The useful lives of our property and equipment are management's estimates when the assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated

<!-- page break -->

useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life.

Servers  and  network  assets  include  equipment  mostly  in  our  data  centers,  which  is  used  to  support  production  traffic.  Land  and  assets  held  within construction in progress (CIP) are not depreciated. CIP assets are related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the related assets.

The  cost  of  maintenance  and  repairs  is  expensed  as  incurred.  When  assets  are  retired  or  otherwise  disposed  of,  the  cost  and  related  accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.

## Lease Obligations

Our operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We determine  if  an  arrangement  is  a  lease  at  inception  and  most  of  our  leases  contain  lease  and  non-lease  components.  Non-lease  components  include  fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes,  or  other  costs. These  amounts are affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase arrangements,  and  maintenance  and  utilities.  Such  variable  lease  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  income.  For  certain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.

For  leases  with  a  lease  term  greater  than  12  months,  ROU  assets  and  lease  liabilities  are  recognized  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  at  the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.

Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment.

Operating  leases  are  included  in  operating  lease  ROU  assets,  operating  lease  liabilities,  current,  and  operating  lease  liabilities,  non-current  on  our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.

During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2024,  2023  and  2022,  we  recorded  net  impairment  losses  of  $383  million,  $2.43  billion,  and  $2.22  billion, respectively,  in  aggregate  for  operating  lease  ROU  assets  and  leasehold  improvements  under  ASC  Topic  360  as  a  part  of  our  facilities  consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 - Restructuring.

<!-- page break -->

## Loss Contingencies

We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We record such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.

If we determine that a loss is probable or reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.

## Business Combinations

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities  is  recorded  as  goodwill  to  reporting  units  based  on  the  expected  benefit  from  the  business  combination. Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  the  amortization  expense,  as  acquired  finite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  the  useful  life,  whereas  any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period,  any  subsequent  adjustments  are  recorded  to  earnings. Acquisition-related  expenses  are  recognized  separately  from  business  combinations  and  are expensed as incurred.

## Goodwill and Intangibles Assets

We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units, Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL), subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.

We evaluate the recoverability  of  finite-lived  intangible  assets  for  possible  impairment  whenever  events  or  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these intangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. The impairment charges of finite-lived intangible assets were not material during the reporting periods presented.

Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not  amortized.  If  an  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  is  subsequently  determined  to  have  a  finite  useful  life,  the  asset  will  be  tested  for  impairment  and accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of  finite-lived  intangible  assets.  If  we  change  the  estimated  useful  life  assumption  for  any  asset,  the  remaining  unamortized  balance  is  amortized  over  the revised estimated useful life. Intangible assets are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.

## Foreign Currency

Generally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive

<!-- page break -->

income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cumulative translation losses, net of tax, of $2.66 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $690 million, $366 million, and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

## Credit Risk and Concentration

Our  financial  instruments  that  are  potentially  subject  to  concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  cash,  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash, marketable debt securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable debt securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our marketable debt securities are held in diversified highly rated securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024 was not material.

Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated 36%, 37%, and 40% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with a majority of the revenue outside of the United States in 2024 coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil, Australia, India and Canada.

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.

No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Beginning in 2024 annual reporting, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable  Segment  Disclosures (ASU  2023-07)  that  was  issued  by  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB).  This  new  standard  requires  an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. Upon adoption, the guidance was applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements, which resulted in the disclosure of employee compensation costs for each reportable segment. For additional information, see Note 16 - Segment and Geographical Information.

## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which improves  the  transparency  of  income  tax  disclosures  by  requiring  consistent  categories  and  greater  disaggregation  of  information  in  the  effective  tax  rate reconciliation  and  income  taxes  paid  disaggregated  by  jurisdiction.  It  also  includes  certain  other  amendments  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  income  tax disclosures. This new standard will be effective for the annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025. The new standard permits early adoption and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (ASU 2024-03). The new guidance requires disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items on an annual and interim basis. This guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2027 and for interim periods thereafter. The new standard permits early adoption and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

## Note 3. Restructuring

## 2022 Restructuring

In  2022,  we  initiated  several  measures  to  pursue  greater  efficiency  and  to  realign  our  business  and  strategic  priorities.  These  measures  included  a facilities  consolidation  strategy  to  sublease,  early  terminate,  or  abandon  several  office  buildings  under  operating  leases,  a  layoff  of  approximately  11,000 employees across the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects (the 2022 Restructuring). As of December 31, 2024, we have completed the 2022 restructuring initiatives.

A summary of our 2022 Restructuring pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, including subsequent adjustments, is as follows (in millions):

## Note 4. Earnings per Share

The holders of our Class A and Class B common stock (together, "common stock") have identical liquidation and dividend rights but different voting rights. Accordingly, we present the earnings per share (EPS) for Class A and Class B common stock together.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common stock outstanding and assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock.

Class A common stock equivalent of restricted stock units (RSUs) with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, approximately 16 million and 95 million shares of RSUs were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, respectively, as including them would have an anti-dilutive effect.

The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

## Note 5. Financial Instruments

## Fair Value Measurements

Our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair values are derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.

The following tables summarize our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the classification by level of input within the fair value hierarchy (in millions):

## Instruments Measured at Fair Value on Non-recurring Basis

Our  non-marketable  equity  securities  accounted  for  using  the  measurement  alternative  are  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  non-recurring  basis  and  are classified  within  Level  3  of  the  fair  value  hierarchy  because  we  use  significant  unobservable  inputs  to  estimate  their  fair  value.  For  the  years  ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, changes in the fair value recorded for these non-marketable equity securities were not material. For additional information, see Note 6 - Non-marketable Equity Securities.

Each series of the Notes in the table above rank equally with each other. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. Interest expense, net of capitalized  interest,  recognized  on  the  Notes  was  $683  million,  $420  million,  and  $160  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024,  2023,  and  2022, respectively.

The total estimated fair value of our outstanding Notes was $27.83 billion and $18.48 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value is determined based on the quoted prices at the end of the reporting periods and categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

## Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies

## Contractual Commitments

We have $32.82 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2024, which are primarily related to our investments in servers and network infrastructure, and content costs. The following is a schedule, by years, of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):

| 2025       | $ 26,335   |
|------------|------------|
| 2026       | 2,548      |
| 2027       | 812        |
| 2028       | 227        |
| 2029       | 153        |
| Thereafter | 2,749      |
| Total      | $ 32,824   |

Additionally, as part of the normal course of business, we have entered into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. We enter into these agreements in order to secure price. Using the expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend related to our renewable energy agreements as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $24.97 billion, a majority of which is due beyond five years. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on actual volume purchased.

## Legal and Related Matters

With respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described below, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters. Unless otherwise noted, with respect to the matters described below that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss, such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate.

We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries and investigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.

The ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.

For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15 - Income Taxes.

## Privacy and Related Matters

Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re Facebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors appealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July  16,  2021,  a  stockholder  derivative  action  was  filed  in  Delaware  Court  of  Chancery  against  certain  of  our  directors  and  officers  asserting  breach  of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs  filed  a  second  amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation . On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.

On May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding ( In the Matter of Facebook, Inc. ) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent order, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a proposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( USA v. Facebook, Inc. ) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On November 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( U.S. v. Facebook, Inc. ) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The underlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to rule.

On November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC ), asserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On December 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the district court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss our complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy ( Jarkesy ). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending appeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy . Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The district court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to dismiss.

On April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the Order to Show Cause proceeding was legally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners on  those  issues  on  November  12,  2024.  On  January  10,  2025,  the  Commission  issued  a  decision  on  certain  threshold  legal  issues,  including  that  the Commission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta's jurisdictional challenges currently pending  before  the  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit  in U.S.  v.  Facebook,  Inc. ,  and  that  the  nature  and  scope  of  any  further administrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional requirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be successful.

We also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, the IDPC is continuing to assess the compliance of our "subscription for no ads" consent model with requirements under the GDPR. In addition, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders, which is described further in "Legal Proceedings" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's cooperation and consistency mechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material individually or in the aggregate.

Beginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals' information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief (for example, In re Meta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor, Inc. et al.; Doe v. GoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the Santa Clara County Superior Court). These cases are in different stages, but several of our motions to dismiss have been denied in whole or in part, while certain others have been granted in whole or in part. We are currently in discovery and litigating class certification in the cases that are most advanced.

## Competition

We are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe,  and  other  jurisdictions.  Such  investigations,  inquiries,  and  lawsuits  concern,  among  other  things,  our  business  practices  in  the  areas  of  social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in 2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint ( FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. On April 5, 2024, we filed our motion for summary judgment and the FTC filed its opposition and its own motion for partial summary judgment on May 24, 2024. On November 13, 2024, the court granted in part and denied in part both our and the FTC's motions for summary judgment. Trial is set to begin on April 14, 2025. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States

<!-- page break -->

and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( Klein et al.,  v.  Meta  Platforms,  Inc. ).  On  January  14,  2022,  the  court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 30, 2024, we filed our motion for summary judgment in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.

In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102 on the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union in relation to certain alleged business practices relating to Facebook Marketplace and imposed a fine of approximately EUR €798 million. We appealed the European Commission's decision on January 28, 2025.

In  March  2024,  the  European  Commission  opened  an  investigation  into  the  compliance  of  our  "subscription  for  no  ads"  consent  model  with requirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act. The European Commission issued preliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.

## Securities and Other Actions

Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case. We filed a petition for writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit's order. The Supreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10, 2024, and following oral argument issued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.

We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same matters, and seeking unspecified damages ( Ohio Pub. Empl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc .). On September 30, 2024, the court dismissed certain claims with leave to amend, but determined certain claims regarding content enforcement practices and user well-being could proceed against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers.

<!-- page break -->

On March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking unspecified damages ( Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On July 18, 2023, the court dismissed the claims against Meta and its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and on September 17, 2024, the court dismissed the claims with prejudice. On October 14, 2024, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal.

## Youth-Related Actions

Beginning  in  January  2022,  we  became  subject  to  litigation  and  other  proceedings  that  were  filed  in  various  federal  and  state  courts  alleging  that Facebook and Instagram cause "social media addiction" in users, with most proceedings focused on those under 18 years old, resulting in various mental health and other harms. Putative class actions have been filed in the United States, Brazil, and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school districts,  municipalities,  and  tribal  nations  have  filed  public  nuisance  claims  in  the  United  States,  Brazil,  and/or  Canada  based  on  similar  allegations.  On October 6, 2022, the U.S. federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In  re  Social  Media Adolescent Addiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation) . Beginning in March 2023, U.S. states and territories began filing lawsuits on these topics in various federal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child sexual abuse material and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business practices, public nuisance, and products liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices (including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years old. These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country. Beginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to 'social media addiction' and related harms allegedly caused by Instagram.

We are  also  subject  to  government  investigations  and  requests  from  multiple  regulators  in  various  jurisdictions  globally  concerning  the  use  of  our products and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA), including the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and other vulnerable users that may stem from the design and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.

## Other Actions

Beginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( DZ Reserve v. Facebook, Inc. )  and  seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court dismissed  certain  of  the  plaintiffs'  claims,  but  permitted  their  fraud  and  unfair  competition  claims  to  proceed.  On  March  29,  2022,  the  court  granted  the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the order granting class certification. On May 3, 2024, we filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was denied by the Ninth Circuit. We filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 2, 2024, which was denied.

Beginning on July 7, 2023, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Chabon, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. and Farnsworth v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ) and U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ( Huckabee, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. et al. , which was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California) alleging that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. These cases have all been consolidated into Kadrey, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc .

On April  30,  2024,  the  European  Commission  opened  formal  proceedings  against  us  to  assess  Facebook  and  Instagram's  compliance  with  certain requirements under Articles 14, 16, 17, 20, 24, 25, 34, 35, and 40 of the DSA, regarding a range of topics including elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential deceptive advertising and disinformation, including the way in which we identified, assessed,  and  mitigated  against  certain  systemic  risks  on  Instagram  and  Facebook. We  are  also  responding  to  regulatory  inquiries  and  litigation  related  to allegedly deceptive advertising, including but not limited to financial scams, in other parts of the world.

On September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise (NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products and services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the Director of the CFPB that the Bureau take legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged receipt and use for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as well as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided us with an opportunity to respond. We disagree with the claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded through the NORA process. The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action against us, the CFPB could file a lawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief.

In addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our  obligation  to  disclose  user  information  in  particular  circumstances. A  number  of  such  instances  have  resulted  in  the  assessment  of  fines  and  penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.

## Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2024, there was not a reasonable possibility we had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. Liabilities recorded for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2024 were not material.

## Note 13. Stockholders' Equity

## Common Stock

Our  certificate  of  incorporation  authorizes  the  issuance  of  Class A  common  stock  and  Class  B  common  stock. As  of  December  31,  2024,  we  are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one  vote,  while  the  holder  of  each  share  of  Class  B  common  stock  is  entitled  to  ten  votes.  Shares  of  our  Class  B  common  stock  are  convertible  into  an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are collectively referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.

As of December 31, 2024, there were 2,190 million shares of Class A common stock and 344 million shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.

## Capital Return Program

## Share Repurchase

Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an  expiration  date. As  of  December  31,  2023,  $30.93  billion  remained  available  and  authorized  for  repurchases  under  this  program.  In  January  2024,  an additional $50 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 65 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $29.75 billion, which includes the 1% excise tax accruals as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of December 31, 2024, $51.28 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.

The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market  conditions,  and  other  investment  opportunities.  Shares  may  be  repurchased  through  open  market  purchases  or  privately  negotiated  transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

## Dividend

Beginning in February 2024, our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share to the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2024 under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was most recently amended in May 2024, are entitled to dividend equivalent rights. During the year ended December 31, 2024, total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $4.38 billion and $691 million for Class A and Class B common stock, respectively.

Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs.

## Share-based Compensation Plan

We have one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was most recently amended in May 2024. Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.

As of December 31, 2024, there were 483 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan.

The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $202.46 and $195.66, respectively.  The  fair  value  as  of  the  respective  vesting  dates  of  RSUs  that  vested  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024,  2023,  and  2022  was $33.14 billion, $17.46 billion, and $9.44 billion, respectively. The income tax benefit recognized related to awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $6.95 billion, $3.65 billion, and $2.00 billion, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024, there was $34.79 billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to RSU awards. This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years based on vesting under the award service conditions.

The valuation allowance was approximately $3.51 billion and $2.88 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, mostly related to U.S. state tax credit carryforwards, U.S. foreign tax credits, and unrealized losses in marketable securities.

As of December 31, 2024, our state net operating loss carryforwards were $2.36 billion, which will begin to expire in 2031, if not utilized. We have federal tax credit carryforwards of $595 million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state tax credit carryforwards of $5.47 billion, most of which do not expire.

Utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three-year period.

The following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

These  unrecognized  tax  benefits  were  primarily  accrued  for  the  uncertainties  with  our  research  tax  credits  and  transfer  pricing  with  our  foreign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions. During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $2.21 billion, $1.48 billion, and $1.07 billion, respectively.

If our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $15.13 billion as of December 31, 2024 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of $10.11 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.

We are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax years. Our 2014 through 2016 tax years are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. We are under examination by the Irish Revenue Commissioners for our 2020 tax year and our 2021 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination.

In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was completed in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2025 which will likely provide a transfer pricing value for intellectual property transferred. This value will need to be extrapolated into income adjustments to determine the specific tax liability, which will likely remain in dispute and will not be resolved until the Tax Court enters a decision. If the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. Once the Tax Court decision is entered, the IRS and Meta will each have the option to file an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.

We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2024, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.

We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

## Note 16. Segment and Geographical Information

We report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other  services.  RL  includes  our  virtual,  augmented,  and  mixed  reality  related  consumer  hardware,  software,  and  content.  Our operating segments are the same as our reportable segments.

Our chief executive officer is our chief operating decision maker (CODM), who allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and income (loss) from operations. Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information.

Revenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include certain product development related operating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs are allocated to segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating segments. Indirect operating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical security expenses are mostly allocated based on headcount. Costs related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure are generally allocated to our segments based on estimated usage, most of which is allocated to the FoA segment.

Beginning  in  2024  annual  reporting,  we  adopted ASU  2023-07  retrospectively.  The  following  table  sets  forth  our  segment  information  of  revenue, expenses, and income (loss) from operations (in millions):

## Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

## Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Changes in Internal Control

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In  designing  and  evaluating  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  management  recognizes  that  any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

## Item 9B. Other Information

## Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans

During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the officers and directors listed below adopted, modified, or terminated trading plans intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

On November 27, 2024, Peggy Alford, a member of our board of directors, entered into a trading plan that provides for the sale of an aggregate of up to $1.2 million worth of shares of our Class A common stock.

## I. Background and Purpose

## A. Why have we adopted this policy?

This policy has been adopted to help you comply with the federal securities laws and to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Under the securities laws, it is generally illegal for any person to trade in the securities of Meta Platforms, Inc. ('Meta' or the 'Company') or any other company while in the possession of material non-public information about that company. It is also generally illegal for any such person to give material non-public information about Meta or any other company to others who then trade on the basis of that information. The consequences of prohibited insider trading or the 'tipping' of material non-public information can be severe for both individuals engaging in such behavior and for Meta. Violators, as well as Meta, its directors and officers and/or the managers of the person violating the rules may be required to pay major civil or criminal penalties (including jail time) and could be subject to private lawsuits in connection with the violation of the insider trading laws.

## B. What is insider trading?

'Insider trading' occurs when any person PURCHASES or SELLS Meta securities on the basis of material non-public information concerning Meta, or from tipping (directly or indirectly passing on) material non-public information to others. Meta securities include not only stocks, but also include options, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), warrants, bonds and notes as well as derivative securities that are not issued by Meta, such as exchange-traded put or call options or swaps relating to Meta's securities. 'Purchase' includes not only the actual purchase of a security, but any contract to purchase or otherwise acquire a security. 'Sale' includes not only the actual sale of a security, but any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of a security.

Does this policy also apply to securities of other companies?

Insider trading on the basis of material non-public information about Meta is prohibited under this policy. In connection with your work at Meta, you may also learn material non-public information about other companies. This policy also prohibits trading in those companies' securities on the basis of material nonpublic information about those companies learned through your employment at Meta, and prohibits tipping (directly or indirectly passing on) material nonpublic information about those companies to others.

Note that if you learn material non-public information that affects multiple other companies, you may not trade the securities of any of those companies. For example, say you learn that Meta has plans to acquire Company A. The acquisition is not material to Meta but it is material non-public information about Company A. There is also a Company B in the same industry that is economically linked to Company A, such that the announcement of the acquisition of Company A could be expected to affect the stock price of Company B. This policy prohibits trading in securities of both Company A and Company B while in possession of that material non-public information.

## C. What is 'Material Non-public Information'?

Information concerning Meta is considered ' MATERIAL ' if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information important in making a decision to purchase or sell Meta's securities. Material information can be positive or negative and can relate to virtually any aspect of Meta's business.

Examples of material information may include (but are not limited to) facts concerning:

- historical or forecasted revenues, earnings or other financial results;
- significant new products or services or other product developments;
- significant new contracts, customers or partners or the loss of a significant contract, customer or partner;

## META PLATFORMS, INC. INSIDER TRADING POLICY

<!-- page break -->

- significant developments regarding Meta's technology or business operations;
- significant, sustained changes in user growth and engagement;
- possible mergers or acquisitions or dispositions of significant subsidiaries or assets, tender offers, joint ventures, restructurings or curtailment of operations;
- pending or threatened significant litigation or regulatory inquiries or developments in existing litigation or inquiries;
- significant cybersecurity incidents or data breaches;
- significant developments in borrowings, or financings or capital investments;
- significant changes in financial condition or asset value or liquidity issues;
- changes in debt ratings, or analyst upgrades or downgrades of Meta or its securities;
- changes in senior management;
- significant changes in corporate strategy;
- changes in accounting methods and write-offs; and
- stock offerings, stock splits or changes in dividend policy.

This list is illustrative only and is not intended to provide a comprehensive list of circumstances that could result in material information. Determination of what may constitute material information will depend upon the facts and circumstances in each particular situation.

Information is ' NON-PUBLIC ' if it is not available to the general public. In order for information to be considered public, it must be generally available to investors and widely disseminated through (i) press releases or corporate blog posts issued by Meta, publicly accessible webcasts or conference calls conducted by Meta or a public filing made by Meta with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'), or (ii) publication in a widely-available newspaper, news magazine or news website. In addition, a sufficient amount of time must pass so that the information has had an opportunity to be digested by the marketplace. As a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until one (1) full trading day after the release of such information.

One helpful way to determine if you have material non-public information is to ask yourself, 'Would the person on the other side of this transaction still want to complete the trade at this price if he or she knew what I know about Meta?' If the answer is 'no,' chances are you possess material nonpublic information.

## A good general rule of thumb: WHEN IN DOUBT, DO NOT TRADE.

## D. Who is covered under this policy?

If you fall under any of the categories below, you are subject to this policy:

- directors, officers and employees of Meta and its subsidiaries;
- spouses, domestic partners, dependent children (whether or not minors) and any other family members who live in the same household of any persons listed in the bullet above;
- consultants and contractors of Meta and its subsidiaries; and
- any persons or entities or accounts controlled by any of the above or which investment decisions are directed or influenced by any of the above.

Any trades in Meta securities made on your behalf, including trades by brokers or other third parties, are subject to this policy, and it is your responsibility to ensure all such trading activity is in compliance with this policy. You should also be aware that trades in Meta securities by other members of your immediate family (e.g. parents or siblings) as well as unrelated members of your household may be heavily scrutinized based on their proximity to you. In an insider trading investigation, the burden of proof is often on the insider to prove that trades made by such persons were not the result of information that the insider may have possessed. Accordingly, while we don't expect you to monitor what is outside of your control, if you are concerned about this possibility, we suggest that you send a message to these people informing them of Meta's regular closed trading period and ask them to comply with the closed trading period.

## E. Who administers this policy?

The Company's Chief Legal Officer administers this policy and serves as the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer (the 'Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer'). In his or her absence, Meta's Chief Financial Officer will serve as the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer. The Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer may also designate one or more individuals in the legal department who may perform the functions of the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer. The Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer will review and either approve or prohibit all proposed trades requiring preapproval under this policy according to the procedures set forth in this policy, except that with respect to the Chief Legal Officer, any proposed trades must be approved by Meta's Chief Financial Officer. All determinations and interpretations by the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer will be final and not subject to further review.

## II. Insider Trading Policies

OVERRIDING RULE: NO ONE CAN TRADE META SECURITIES WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION, AND NO ONE CAN HELP OR ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO TRADE META SECURITIES WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION.

## A. No Trading on Material Non-public Information

If you possess material non-public information, you may not purchase or sell, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, any of Meta's securities, during any period beginning with the date you received the material non-public information concerning Meta, and ending at market open on the second full trading day after public disclosure of that information, or at such time when the non-public information is no longer material.

## B. No Trading During Closed Trading Periods; Pre-Clearance of Certain Transactions

## 1. Regular Closed Trading Period

You may not trade in any security of Meta during the period beginning at market close on the last day of the middle month of any fiscal quarter of Meta and ending at market open on the second full trading day after the public release of earnings data for such fiscal quarter (a 'Regular Closed Trading Period'). For example, if Meta announces its prior fiscal quarter earnings on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 28th, then the Regular Closed Trading Period will end at market open on Friday, July 30th, and you would potentially be able to trade in the 'open trading window' from Friday, July 30th through market close on August 31st. However, these open trading windows should not be considered a safe harbor, as you are always restricted from trading under this policy if you possess material non-public information, even during open trading windows.

## 2. Special Closed Trading Period

The Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer may suspend trading in Meta securities from time to time for some or all persons subject to this policy because of material developments known to Meta or certain persons within Meta and not yet disclosed to the public, as he or she deems appropriate (a 'Special Closed Trading Period' and together with a Regular Closed Trading Period, a 'Closed Trading Period'), and need not provide any reason for such suspension. The Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee will notify you if you are subject to a Special Closed Trading Period, and may not explain the reasons.

## 3. Pre-Clearance of Trades of Restricted Persons

In addition to being subject to the Closed Trading Periods described above, and subject to the 10b5-1 Trading Plan requirements for 10b5-1 Designated Persons described below, all members of the Company's Board of Directors and 'Section 16 officers' (as defined below) and certain other designated employees, consultants and contractors

<!-- page break -->

(collectively, the 'Restricted Persons') will be designated on a 'Pre-Clear List' and will be required to pre-clear ALL trades in Meta securities with the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee prior to trading in Meta's securities, even during an open trading window. These Restricted Persons must contact the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer prior to commencing any trade in Meta's securities. The Company will notify you if you are on the Pre-Clear List.

Approval of trades by Restricted Persons on the Pre-Clear List is in the sole discretion of Meta. If a transaction is approved, you must execute the transaction within five (5) trading days after the day you receive such approval, but in no event after the commencement of a Closed Trading Period. If for any reason you do not complete the trade within five (5) trading days after you receive approval, you must obtain pre-clearance again before you can trade the securities. For example, if the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee approves a trade on a Friday, then you will have until the end of the trading day the following Friday to complete your trade.

Any requests to approve a trade while you are subject to a Closed Trading Period will be denied.

## 4. Pre-Clearance of Gifts by 10b5-1 Designated Persons

All 10b5-1 Designated Persons must also pre-clear all gifts of Meta securities and transfers of Meta securities for estate planning purposes with the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee prior to such transfer, even during an open trading window.

## C. No Tipping

You may not tip (i.e. directly or indirectly pass on) material non-public information to any other person where the information may be used by such person to trade in the securities to which such information relates. You may not make recommendations or express opinions as to trading in Meta's securities. For example, you may not suggest, encourage or recommend that others buy or sell Meta's securities (or that they refrain from buying or selling in any setting), including through participation in any investment or stock-related Meta group, message board or other similar medium.

## D. No Margining or Pledging of Company Securities

You may not hold Meta securities in margin accounts or pledge such securities as collateral for a loan except in limited circumstances as approved by the Compensation, Nominating, &amp; Governance Committee. However, you may maintain a margin account so long as you do not hold Meta securities in the account, or otherwise use the account to trade Meta securities on margin, or otherwise use Meta securities as collateral.

## E. No Trading in Futures or Derivative Securities or Hedging

You may not purchase or sell futures or derivative securities relating to Meta securities, or engage in hedging activities relating to Meta securities, including exchange traded options to purchase or sell such securities, puts, calls, collars, forward sale contracts, equity swaps, exchange funds, or other arrangements or instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of Meta securities.

Investments in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds ('ETFs') that track a broad-based index (such as the S&amp;P 500) and/or have holdings comprised of less than 10% in Meta stock are exempt from this policy. However, investments in any other mutual fund or ETF where Meta stock comprises 10% or more of such fund's holdings are subject to this policy and shares of such mutual fund or ETF are treated as if they were Meta securities.

## F. No Short Sales

You may not sell Meta securities 'short' (meaning any transaction in which you would benefit from a decline in the price of the securities).

## G. No Trading on Information Regarding Other Companies

If you, in the course of working for Meta, learn of material non-public information about another company, you may not trade in that company's securities until the information becomes public or is no longer material. You should treat material non-public information about Meta's business associates with the same care required with respect to information related directly to Meta.

<!-- page break -->

## H. Confidentiality of Non-public Information

Non-public information relating to Meta is the property of Meta and the unauthorized disclosure or improper use of such information is forbidden. You may not disclose material non-public information to other persons within Meta whose jobs do not require them to have that information, or outside of Meta to other persons, unless such disclosure is made in accordance with Meta's policies regarding the protection or unauthorized external disclosure of information regarding Meta. In addition, your confidentiality agreement with Meta provides that Meta confidential information will only be used for the benefit of the company and solely to the extent necessary to perform your job. Any other use-such as trading on such information for personal benefit/profit-is prohibited. In addition to violating this policy and/or your confidentiality agreement, any unauthorized disclosures or improper use of such information may also violate Meta's agreements with third parties and may be in breach of your fiduciary, loyalty or other duties to Meta.

## III. Exceptions to Trading Restrictions

## A. 10b5-1 Trading Plans

Transactions in Meta's securities that are executed pursuant to an approved trading plan established pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (a '10b5-1 Trading Plan'), will not be subject to this policy. SEC Rule 10b5-1 generally provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability under the federal securities laws for securities trading plans that are entered into in good faith when you are not in possession of material non-public information and with respect to which you act in good faith for the duration of the plan.

The 10b5-1 Trading Plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or include a written formula or algorithm, or computer program, for determining the number of shares, prices and dates. Once a 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, you must not exercise any subsequent influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of any trades under the plan. All 10b5-1 Trading Plans, including any modifications, terminations, or other changes of such plans, must be pre-approved by the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee and may only be adopted, modified or terminated when you are not subject to a Closed Trading Period and not in possession of material non-public information.

Subject to the Transition Period and Affiliated Fund Exclusion provisions described in the Company's 10b5-1 Trading Plan Policy, '10b5-1 Designated Persons' (as defined below) are required to conduct all purchase and sale transactions involving Meta's securities, including the sale of Meta securities that they control through a trust or other entity, through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and shall not be entitled to conduct transactions in open trading windows outside of a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. However, bona fide gifts, any transfers pursuant to a divorce settlement/agreement or other similar court order, or transfers for estate planning purposes by 10b5-1 Designated Persons need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. In addition, sales by foundations or other charitable entities controlled by 10b5-1 Designated Persons of shares received as a result of a bona fide gift need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan if (a) the underlying gift was effected during an open trading window and (b) the decision to sell such gifted securities is made by an independent investment committee without any consultation with or influence of the transferor. For purposes of this policy, '10b5-1 Designated Persons' means the following individuals: (i) members of Meta's Board of Directors, (ii) Meta's 'officers' as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, 'Section 16 officers'), and (iii) certain other individuals (such as members of management who report directly to Meta's Chief Executive Officer) who may be designated from time to time by joint approval of the Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

For more information, see Meta's 10b5-1 Trading Plan Policy.

## B. Bona Fide Gifts and Other Transfers Without Consideration

Bona fide gifts or other transfers without consideration are exempt from this policy; provided that, for gifts or other transfers without consideration made (i) in a Closed Trading Period or (ii) at a time when you possess material non-public information, the recipient must agree not to sell Meta securities before the earliest time after the gift is completed that you are permitted to sell Meta securities on the open market under this policy. In addition, 10b5-1

<!-- page break -->

Designated Persons must comply with the requirements regarding pre-clearance of gifts under Section II(B)(4) of this policy.

## C. Divorce Agreement or Other Court Orders

Transfers of Meta securities pursuant to a divorce agreement or settlement, or other similar court order, are exempt from this policy in a Closed Trading Period.

## D. Partnership Distributions

Distributions of Meta securities by a venture capital partnership or other similar entity with which a Company director is affiliated to its partners, members or other similar persons are generally subject to this policy, unless the entity provides evidence satisfactory to the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer that such entity has adequate policies and procedures in place to ensure that individuals making investment decisions on its behalf would not violate insider trading laws. It is the responsibility of each affected director and the affiliated entity, in consultation with their own counsel, to determine the process and timing for any such distributions based on all relevant facts and circumstances and applicable securities laws.

## E. Company Incentive Plans

This policy does not apply to (i) the vesting or settlement of RSUs, (ii) the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which Meta elects to withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any RSUs or (iii) a sell to cover transaction (x) under which you have previously elected to have a broker sell vested RSUs to cover any applicable tax withholding requirements (so long as such sell to cover election was made in an open window and when you were not in possession of material non-public information) or (y) which is otherwise mandated by Meta. This policy does apply, however, to any sale of Meta shares that you actually receive upon vesting and settlement of your RSUs.

## IV. Penalties for Violation

Violation of the rules in this policy is grounds for disciplinary action by Meta, including termination of employment. Trading on or tipping (i.e. directly or indirectly passing on) material non-public information can also result in disgorgement of all profits and the imposition of substantial fines, extending significantly beyond any profits made or losses avoided, both for you and Meta.

## V. Individual Responsibility

You are individually responsible for complying with this policy, including the determination of whether you possess material non-public information. You may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in Meta's securities even if you had planned to make the transaction before learning of any material non-public information and even though you believe you may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting.

None of Meta, the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or Meta's other employees will have any liability for any delay in reviewing, or refusal of, a request for pre-clearance of any potential trade or a trading plan. Notwithstanding any review of any pre-clearance of a transaction or any review of a trading plan, none of Meta, the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or Meta's other employees assumes any liability for the legality or consequences of such trading plan or transaction to your engagement in or adoption of such transaction or trading plan.

## VI. Inquiries

Please direct all inquiries regarding any of the provisions or procedures of this policy to the Meta legal department.

## VII. Amendments and Waivers

Amendments to this policy, and waivers requested by any director or Section 16 officer of Meta, must be approved by action of the Board of Directors or the Compensation, Nominating &amp; Governance Committee. All other waivers under this policy may be approved by the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer after consulting with legal counsel. (Amended September 5, 2024)

## I. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE

## A. Why has Meta adopted this policy?

This policy has been adopted to help you comply with the requirements necessary to properly implement and maintain an approved trading plan established pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1 (a '10b5-1 Trading Plan') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act').

Under applicable federal and state securities laws, it is generally illegal for any person to trade in the securities of Meta while in the possession of material non-public information about the company. Meta has adopted an 'Insider Trading Policy' that sets forth the policies and procedures that have been implemented to assist your compliance with these laws. This policy on 10b5-1 Trading Plans makes reference to and uses terms that are defined in the Insider Trading Policy, so please review it in its entirety before reviewing this policy on 10b5-1 Trading Plans.

## B. What is a 10b5-1 Trading Plan?

As provided in the Insider Trading Policy, transactions in Meta's securities that are executed pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 Trading Plan will not be subject to the restrictions of the Insider Trading Policy, and SEC Rule 10b5-1 generally provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability under  the  federal  securities  laws  for  securities  trading  plans  meeting  certain  conditions,  that  are  entered  into  in  good  faith  when  you  are  not  in possession of material non-public information and with respect to which you act in good faith for the duration of the plan.

## C. How does a 10b5-1 Trading Plan Work?

The 10b5-1 Trading Plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or delegate discretion on those matters to an independent third party. Once a 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, you must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of any trades under the plan. All 10b5-1 Trading Plans, including any modification or other change of such plans, must be pre-approved by the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer (as set forth in Section II(H) below) and may only be adopted or modified when you are not subject to a Closed Trading Period and not in possession of material non-public information.

## D. Am I required to adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan? Am I subject to this policy if I am not required to adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan, but decide to do so voluntarily?

Subject  to  the  Transition  Period  and Affiliated  Fund  Exclusion  provisions  described  below,  '10b5-1  Designated  Persons'  (as  defined  below)  are required to conduct all purchase and sale transactions involving Meta's securities, including the sale of Meta securities that they control through a trust or other entity, through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and will not be entitled to conduct transactions in open trading windows outside of a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. However, bona fide gifts, any transfers pursuant to a divorce settlement/agreement or other similar court order, or transfers for estate planning purposes by 10b5-1 Designated Persons need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. In addition, sales by foundations or other charitable entities controlled by 10b5-1 Designated Persons of shares received as a result of a bona fide gift need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan if (a) the underlying gift was effected during an open trading window while not in possession of material non-public information and (b) the decision to  sell  such  gifted  securities  is  made  by  an  independent  investment  committee  without  any  consultation  with  or  influence  of  the  transferor.  For purposes of this policy, '10b5-1 Designated Persons' means the following

## META PLATFORMS, INC. 10b5-1 TRADING PLAN POLICY (Amended September 7, 2023)

<!-- page break -->

individuals:  (i)  members  of  Meta's  Board  of  Directors,  (ii)  Meta's  "officers"  as  defined  under  Rule  16a-1(f)  promulgated  under  the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, 'Section 16 officers'), and (iii) certain other individuals (such as members of management who report directly to Meta's Chief Executive Officer) who may be designated from time to time by joint approval of the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

Other personnel who are not 10b5-1 Designated Persons may also adopt 10b5-1 Trading Plans, and those plans will also be subject to this policy in the same manner as plans adopted by 10b5-1 Designated Persons.

Affiliated Fund Exclusion : For purposes of members of the Board of Directors under this policy, 'Meta securities' excludes all Meta securities held or controlled by venture capital investment partnerships or other similar entities affiliated with such directors, provided such directors or their immediate family members or an entity formed for the benefit of such directors or their immediate family members are not the primary beneficiaries of such partnerships  or  entities. An  immediate  family  member  of  a  director  includes  such  director's  spouse  (or  spousal  equivalent),  parents,  stepparents, children,  stepchildren,  siblings,  dependents,  mothers-  and  fathers-in-law,  sons-  and  daughters-in-law,  brothers-  and  sisters-in-law,  and  any  person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the director's household.

Transition Period: If an individual is appointed to an employee role that is designated as a 10b5-1 Designated Person, or an employee is otherwise designated as a 10b5-1 Designated Person for the first time, such employee will be entitled to trade Meta securities outside of a 10b5-1 Trading Plan: (a) if appointed or designated during an open trading window, for the remainder of such open trading window, or (b) if appointed or designated during a closed trading window, for the duration of the next open trading window following such appointment or designation; provided however, that the foregoing transition period will not apply to any person appointed to a role that is designated a Section 16 officer position and will not apply to any person who was already required to conduct all trades of Meta securities through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan under this policy.

## E. Who should I contact with questions about 10b5-1 Trading Plans?

Meta's  Chief  Legal  Officer  administers  this  policy  and  Meta's  10b5-1  Plan  Standards  (attached  hereto  as  Exhibit A),  and  serves  as  the  10b5-1 Compliance Officer (the '10b5-1 Compliance Officer'). In the Chief Legal Officer's absence, Meta's Chief Financial Officer will serve as the 10b5-1 Compliance  Officer.  The  10b5-1  Compliance  Officer  may  also  designate  one  or  more  individuals  in  the  legal  department  who  may  perform  the functions of the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer. All determinations and interpretations by the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer will be final and not subject to further review.

## II. 10b5-1 TRADING PLANS - CONDITIONS OF IMPLEMENTATION

A person subject to the Insider Trading Policy may adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and engage in transactions in Meta securities pursuant to such plan provided that each of the following conditions is satisfied and the general terms and circumstances of such plan are consistent with Meta's 10b5-1 Plan Standards, attached here to as Exhibit A.

## A. Intended to Satisfy the Affirmative Defense Conditions of Rule 10b5-1

The  10b5-1  Trading  Plan  must  be  intended  to  satisfy  the  affirmative  defense  conditions  of  Exchange  Act  Rule  10b5-1(c)  and  comply  with  the requirements of said Rule 10b5-1(c) and include a statement to that general effect which includes, but is not limited to, the fact that the plan was entered into in good faith and that you will act in good faith with respect to the plan for the duration of the plan.

## B. Formulaic Execution or No Exercise of Discretion

With respect to any transaction in Meta securities, the 10b5-1 Trading Plan either (i) expressly specifies the amount, price and date, (ii) provides a written formula or algorithm, or computer program, for determining amounts, prices and dates, or (iii) does not permit the person subject to this policy to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when, or whether to effect such purchase or sale, but does allow this discretion to be exercised by a broker or other authorized third party (provided any broker or authorized third party with such influence does not have access to any material nonpublic information regarding Meta or its securities when exercising such influence). The type of transaction activity under the 10b5-1 Trading Plan must not violate the terms of the Insider Trading Policy, for example, the restrictions on hedging, short sales, or transactions in derivative securities. For the avoidance of doubt, the 10b5-1 Trading Plan may provide for transactions in shares underlying RSUs granted by Meta following the date of adoption of the 10b5-1 Trading Plan ('Future RSU Grants'), provided that the 10b5-1 Trading Plan specifies the amount, price and date of transactions in shares underlying Future RSU Grants.

<!-- page break -->

## C. Timeframe for Adoption, Modification or Termination

The 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, Modified (as defined below), or terminated (i) only when the person is not in possession of material nonpublic information concerning the company or its securities and (ii) not subject to a Closed Trading Period (whether a Regular Closed Trading Period or a Special Closed Trading Period). For purposes of this policy, the terms 'Modified' and 'Modification' shall be defined to include any modification or change to the amount, price or timing of the purchase or sale of securities under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan (including, but not limited to: (i) adding or subtracting shares from the plan, (ii) changing the limit or sales prices contained in the plan, (iii) adding trading language to the plan, (iv) changing the trading dates or duration of the plan, or (v) changing vesting calculations, even if the result of errors). Administrative or other immaterial changes that do not affect the amount, price or timing of purchases or sales under the plan (including, but not limited to: (i) correcting grant identifiers, or (ii) correcting typos or other scriveners errors) do not constitute a "Modification.' In addition, re-assignment of a plan to another broker will not constitute a "Modification" provided such re-assignment does not result in any change to existing purchase or sale instructions. In the event of any dispute, the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer shall determine whether a change to a plan is deemed a Modification. Modifications should be made infrequently.

## D. No Violations of Section 16 or Rule 144

The trades under the 10b5-1 Trading Plan do not violate the trading restrictions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

## E. Prompt Third-Party Confirmations

The financial institution administering the 10b5-1 Trading Plan must agree to provide prompt confirmation to Meta of any proposed modification, suspension, termination or other change of the 10b5-1 Trading Plan.

## F. Legal Expenses

If a proposed 10b5-1 Trading Plan contains complex provisions, Meta may condition its review on participant's agreement to pay Meta's expenses for legal advice related to the review process. Additionally, if a proposed 10b5-1 Trading Plan contains complex provisions, Meta's review may be subject to delay.

## G. Termination or Suspension Right in Favor of the Company

The 10b5-1 Trading Plan must provide that Meta can terminate or suspend the 10b5-1 Trading Plan, in its sole discretion, by notice to the financial institution  and  the  participant.  The  10b5-1  Trading  Plan  must  also  provide  Meta  with  the  right  to  suspend  sales  due  to  regulatory  requirements, including Regulation M under the Exchange Act, or for other reasons such as lock up agreements in connection with underwritten public offerings.

## H. Prior Notice to the Company and Company Acknowledgement

A copy of the 10b5-1 Trading Plan, and any subsequent Modification or other change thereto, must be provided to the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer (or in the case of the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer, to the CFO) on the time frame specified by the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer or the Meta legal department to allow for approval pursuant to the Insider Trading Policy. If the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer does not acknowledge the plan or any subsequent Modification or other change thereto within ten (10) business days of delivery (whether acknowledged by signature, email approval or delivery of an issuer certificate or similar instrument), the plan or Modification or other change will not be deemed to be pre-approved under the Insider Trading Policy.

<!-- page break -->

## I. Commencement of Trading

Trades under the 10b5-1 Trading Plan, or any subsequent Modification thereto, do not commence until (i) for employees other than members of the Board of Directors and Section 16 Officers, at least ninety (90) days have elapsed from the date the 10b5-1 Trading Plan, or any such Modification, as the case may be, is entered into by the plan participant and broker (the 'signing date') and (ii) for members of the Board of Directors and Section 16 Officers, the later of ninety (90) days after the signing date or two (2) business days following disclosure of Meta's financial results on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter in which the signing date occurred, provided that in no event shall such date be more than 120 days from the signing date (the periods set forth in (i) and (ii), each a 'Cooling-Off Period') (and provided in each case that such plan or Modification is acknowledged by the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer pursuant to the Insider Trading Policy within ten (10) business days of the signing date).

## III. Inquiries

Please direct all inquiries regarding any of the provisions or procedures of this policy to the Meta legal department.

## IV. Amendments and Waivers

Amendments to, or waivers under, this policy may be approved by action of the Board of Directors or the Compensation, Nominating &amp; Governance Committee. In addition, the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer may approve waivers under this policy after consulting with legal counsel. The 10b5-1 Plan Standards attached as Exhibit A may be amended or waived by the Board of Directors, the Compensation, Nominating &amp; Governance Committee or the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer.

<!-- page break -->

## EXHIBIT A

## Meta's 10b5-1 Plan Standards

## (Amended January 29, 2023)

1. Specialized 10b5-1 Broker :  Employees and directors who wish to enter into 10b5-1 plans must use Charles Schwab for execution of such plans. This aligns with Meta's use of Charles Schwab as Meta's sole broker for the Meta equity program. By limiting employees and directors to the selected broker for this purpose, Meta hopes to reduce employee fees, facilitate use of 10b5-1 plans by all interested employees, ease administration of plans, and enable the execution of transactions in a more orderly fashion. Charles Schwab shall provide a form of 10b5-1 plan document for use by employees and directors, as discussed further in Section 2, below.
2. Overlapping Plans; Specific Plan Standards for the Broker: Each individual can only have one (1) active trading plan in place at a time. In addition, each individual can only have one (1) 'single trade' 10b5-1 trading plan during any 12-month period. If you control, or direct or influence investment decisions of, any trust or other entity, you may not enter into a separate trading plan for the trust or other entity, but you may include the shares held by such trust or other entity in your individual plan.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual may enter into a second trading plan so long as such second plan does not begin trading until after all trades under the first plan are completed or expired without execution.

Plans with Charles Schwab typically utilize specified determinants regarding date(s), prices(s), start and end dates and share amounts to be sold under the 10b5-1 plan using a template provided by Charles Schwab. Plans with Charles Schwab cannot include determinants that are derived through employee or director-provided formulas or algorithms, but can include volume weighted average price (VWAP).

3. Number of Shares : There is no limitation on the number of shares that a 10b5-1 plan can cover; however, each individual share of stock can only be covered by one (1) 10b5-1 plan. In addition, there must be a sufficient number of shares in the 10b5-1-related brokerage account to cover any balance of shares available for sale under the applicable 10b5-1 plan.
4. Duration : A 10b5-1 plan cannot have a duration longer than two years.
