## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively 'Apple' or the 'Company'). In the opinion of the Company's management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ('GAAP')  requires  the  use  of  management  estimates.  Certain  prior  period  amounts  in  the  condensed consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  period's  presentation.  These  condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the '2023 Form 10-K').

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

## Note 2 - Revenue

Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

|                                 | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|                                 | December 30, 2023    | December 31, 2022    |

| iPad ®                          | 7,023                | 9,396                |
| Wearables, Home and Accessories | 11,953               | 13,482               |
| Services                        | 23,117               | 20,766               |
| Total net sales                 | $ 119,575            | $ 117,154            |

Total  net  sales  include  $3.5  billion  of  revenue  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended  December  30,  2023  that  was  included  in  deferred  revenue  as  of September  30,  2023  and  $3.4  billion  of  revenue  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2022  that  was  included  in  deferred  revenue  as  of September 24, 2022.

The  Company's  proportion  of  net  sales  by  disaggregated  revenue  source  was  generally  consistent  for  each  reportable  segment  in  Note  10,  'Segment Information and Geographic Data' for the three months ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

As of December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.

|                                           | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|

| Net income                                | $ 33,916             | $ 29,998             |
| Denominator:                              |                      |                      |
| Weighted-average basic shares outstanding | 15,509,763           | 15,892,723           |
| Effect of dilutive share-based awards     | 66,878               | 62,995               |
| Weighted-average diluted shares           | 15,576,641           | 15,955,718           |
| Basic earnings per share                  | $ 2.19               | $ 1.89               |
| Diluted earnings per share                | $ 2.18               | $ 1.88               |

Approximately  89  million  restricted  stock  units  ('RSUs')  were  excluded  from  the  computation  of  diluted  earnings  per  share  for  the  three  months  ended December 31, 2022 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not  to  hedge  certain  exposures  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  accounting  considerations  or  the  prohibitive  economic  cost  of  hedging  particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates,  as  well  as  to  offset  a  portion  of  the  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  generated  by  the  remeasurement  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

## Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

## Accounts Receivable

## Trade Receivables

The Company's third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 34% and 41% of total trade receivables as of December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.

## Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 50% and 20%. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.

## Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This  Item  and  other  sections  of  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  ('Form  10-Q')  contain  forward-looking  statements,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company's business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as 'future,' 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'expects,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'predicts,' 'will,' 'would,' 'could,' 'can,' 'may,' and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading 'Risk Factors.' The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

## Available Information

The  Company  periodically  provides  certain  information  for  investors on  its  corporate  website,  www.apple.com,  and  its  investor  relations  website, investor.apple.com.  This  includes  press  releases  and  other  information  about  financial  performance,  information  on  environmental,  social  and  governance matters, and details related to the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.

## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.

## Fiscal Period

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively.

## Quarterly Highlights

The Company's first quarter of 2024 included 13 weeks, compared to 14 weeks during the first quarter of 2023.

The Company's total net sales increased 2% or $2.4 billion during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023, driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories.

During the first quarter of 2024, the Company announced an updated MacBook Pro 14-in., MacBook Pro 16-in. and iMac . ® ®

The Company repurchased $20.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2024.

## Macroeconomic Conditions

Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

## Research and Development

Research and development ('R&amp;D') expense was relatively flat during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023.

## Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expense increased 3% or $179 million during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):

|                                   | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|                                   | December 30, 2023    | December 31, 2022    |
| Provision for income taxes        | $ 6,407              | $ 5,625              |
| Effective tax rate                | 15.9%                | 15.8%                |
| Statutory federal income tax rate | 21%                  | 21%                  |

The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the impact of the U.S. federal R&amp;D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.

The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was relatively flat compared to the same quarter in 2023.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.

The Company's contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2023 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.

## Manufacturing Purchase Obligations

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $38.0 billion, with $37.9 billion payable within 12 months.

## Capital Return Program

In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 30, 2023, the Company's quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

## Income Taxes

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the 'FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ('ASU 2023-09'), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026. ASU 2023-09 allows for adoption using either a prospective or retrospective transition method.

## Segment Reporting

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ('ASU 2023-07'), which will  require  the  Company  to  disclose  segment  expenses  that  are  significant  and  regularly  provided  to  the  Company's  chief  operating  decision  maker ('CODM'). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, 'Summary of  Significant Accounting  Policies'  of  the  Notes  to  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  I,  Item  1  of  this  Form  10-Q  and  in  the  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K.

## Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There have been no material changes to the Company's market risk during the first three months of 2024. For a discussion of the Company's exposure to market risk, refer to the Company's market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' of the 2023 Form 10-K.

## Item 4.    Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits  under  the  Exchange Act  is  (i)  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial  reporting  during  the  first  quarter  of  2024,  which  were  identified  in  connection  with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

## PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

## Item 1.    Legal Proceedings

## Epic Games

Epic  Games,  Inc.  ('Epic')  filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  California  (the  'District  Court')  against  the  Company  alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store . On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic's claim. The District Court found that certain provisions  of  the  Company's App  Store  Review  Guidelines  violate  California's  unfair  competition  law  and  issued  an  injunction  enjoining  the  Company  from prohibiting  developers  from  including  in  their  apps  external  links  that  direct  customers  to  purchasing  mechanisms  other  than Apple  in-app  purchasing.  The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the 'Circuit Court') affirmed the District Court's ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple's motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court (the 'Supreme Court'). On January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court denied both the Company's and Epic's petitions and the stay terminated. The Supreme Court's denial of Epic's petition confirms the District Court's ruling in favor of the Company with respect to all of the antitrust claims. Following termination of the stay, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the District Court. On January 31, 2024, Epic filed a notice with the District Court indicating its intent to dispute the Company's compliance plan. ® ®

## Masimo

Masimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, 'Masimo') filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the 'ITC') alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought  a  permanent  exclusion  order  prohibiting  importation  to  the  U.S.  of  certain Apple  Watch  models  that  include  blood  oxygen  sensing  functionality.  On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the 'Order') prohibiting importation and sales in the U.S. of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra™ 2. The Company subsequently proposed a redesign of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the 'CBP') and appealed the Order. On January 12, 2024, the CBP found that the Company's proposed redesign of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 falls outside the scope of the Order, permitting the Company to import and sell the models in the U.S. ®

## Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for  amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

## Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or  unknown,  including  those  described  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  the  2023  Form  10-K  under  the  heading  'Risk  Factors.'  When  any  one  or  more  of  these  risks materialize from time to time, the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company's risk factors since the 2023 Form 10-K.

## The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.

From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.

<!-- page break -->

In January 2024, the Company announced changes to iOS, the App Store and Safari in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the 'DMA'), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Although the Company's compliance plan is intended to address the DMA's obligations, it is still subject to potential challenge by the European Commission or private litigants. In addition, other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the European Union are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks the DMA poses to European Union users, many risks will remain. ®

The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against  the  Company  that  could,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  have  a  materially  adverse  impact  on  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

Further,  the  Company  has  commercial  relationships  with  other  companies  in  the  technology  industry  that  are  or  may  become  subject  to  investigations  and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company's commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company's platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.

There  can  be  no  assurance  the  Company's  business  will  not  be  materially  adversely  affected,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  by  the  outcomes  of  such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company's business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company's products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.

(1) As of December 30, 2023, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase up to $90 billion of the Company's common stock under a share repurchase program announced on May 4, 2023, of which $36.4 billion had been utilized. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.

(2) In August  2023,  the  Company  entered  into  accelerated  share  repurchase  agreements  ('ASRs')  to  purchase  up  to  a  total  of  $5.0  billion  of  the  Company's common stock. In October 2023, the purchase periods for these ASRs ended and an additional 6 million shares were delivered and retired.
