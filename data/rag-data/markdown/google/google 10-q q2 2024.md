## Note About Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding:

- the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success and trends in our business;
- fluctuations in our revenues and margins and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
- our expectation that the continuing shift from an offline to online world will continue to benefit our business;
- our expectation that the portion of our revenues that we derive beyond advertising will continue to increase and may affect our margins;
- our expectation that our traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and the associated TAC rate will fluctuate, which could affect our overall margins;
- our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins;
- fluctuations in paid clicks and cost-per-click as well as impressions and cost-per-impression, and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
- our expectation that we will continue to periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and impressions;
- our  expectation  that  our  results  will  be  affected  by  our  performance  in  international  markets  as  users  in  developing  economies increasingly come online;
- our  expectation  that  our  foreign  exchange  risk  management  program  will  not  fully  offset  our  net  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign currency exchange rates;
- the expected variability of gains and losses related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program;
- the  amount  and  timing  of  revenue  recognition  from  customer  contracts  with  commitments  for  performance  obligations,  including  our estimate of the remaining amount of commitments and when we expect to recognize revenue;
- our expectation that our capital expenditures will increase, including the expected increase in our technical infrastructure investment to support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  our  long-term  initiatives,  in  particular  in  support  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  products  and services;
- our plans to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and systems, as well as to continue to invest in acquisitions and strategic investments;
- our pace of hiring and our plans to provide competitive compensation programs;
- our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development (R&amp;D) expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses may increase in amount and/or may increase as a percentage of revenues and may be affected by a number of factors;
- estimates of our future compensation expenses;
- our expectation that our other income (expense), net (OI&amp;E), will fluctuate in the future, as it is largely driven by market dynamics;
- our expectation that our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years;
- seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;
- the sufficiency of our sources of funding;
- our potential exposure in connection with new and pending investigations, proceedings, and other contingencies, including the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results;
- our  expectation  that  we  will  continue  to  face  heightened  regulatory  scrutiny,  and  changes  in  regulatory  conditions,  laws,  and  public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results;

## Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Nature of Operations

Google  was  incorporated  in  California  in  September  1998  and  re-incorporated  in  the  State  of  Delaware  in August  2003.  In  2015,  we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure  and  platform  services  as  well  as  communication  and  collaboration  tools;  sales  of  other  products  and  services,  such  as  fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.

## Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

## Unaudited Interim Financial Information

These  unaudited  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles  in  the  United  States  (GAAP),  and  in  our  opinion,  include  all  adjustments  of  a  normal  recurring  nature  necessary  for  fair  financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

These  consolidated  financial  statements  and  other  information  presented  in  this  Form  10-Q  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In  November  2023,  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2023-07  "Segment Reporting  (Topic  280):  Improvements  to  Reportable  Segment  Disclosures"  which  expands  annual  and  interim  disclosure  requirements  for reportable  segments,  primarily  through  enhanced  disclosures  about  significant  segment  expenses. ASU  2023-07  is  effective  for  our  annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose standardized categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. ASU 2023-09 will also require income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. We will adopt ASU 2023-09 for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025.

## Revenue Backlog

As of June 30, 2024, we had $78.8 billion of remaining performance obligations ('revenue backlog'), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue  backlog  represents  commitments  in  customer  contracts  for  future  services  that  have  not  yet  been  recognized  as  revenue.  The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as  well  as  amounts  that  will  be  invoiced  in  future  periods,  and  excludes  contracts  with  an  original  expected  term  of  one  year  or  less  and cancellable contracts.

## Deferred Revenues

We record  deferred  revenues  when  cash  payments  are  received  or  due  in  advance  of  our  performance,  including  amounts  which  are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $2.9 billion was recognized as revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2024.

## Note 3. Financial Instruments

## Fair Value Measurements

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets

<!-- page break -->

or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.

Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&amp;E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

The following  tables  summarize  our  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  marketable  securities  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis  (in millions):

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are  classified  within  Level  2  or  Level  3  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy.  Non-marketable  equity  securities  that  have  been  remeasured  due  to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.

As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $31.6 billion, of which $2.2 billion were remeasured at fair  value  during  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2024  and  classified  within  Level  2  and  Level  3  of  the  fair  value  hierarchy  at  the  time  of measurement.

## Equity Investments

The carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). Gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on OI&amp;E.

The carrying values for marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions):

Unrealized gain (loss) on non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is comprised of $75 million and $319 million of upward adjustments and $789 million and $745 million of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $989 million and $3.1 billion of upward adjustments and $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. (1)

In the table above, realized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later.

Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected  in  periods  prior  to  the  period  of  sale,  we  believe  they  are  important  supplemental  information  as  they  reflect  the economic net gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

## Equity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method

As  of  December  31,  2023  and  June  30,  2024,  equity  securities  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  had  a  carrying  value  of approximately $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on OI&amp;E.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.

We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair  values  and  present  all  other  derivatives  at  gross  fair  values. The  accounting  treatment  for  derivatives  is  based  on  the  intended  use  and hedge designation.

## Cash Flow Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.

Cash  flow  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred  in  AOCI  and  subsequently  reclassified  to revenue  when  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in  earnings.  We  exclude  forward  points  and  time  value  from  our  assessment  of  hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.

As of June 30, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $300 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.

## Fair Value Hedges

We  designate  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  as  fair  value  hedges  to  hedge  foreign  currency  risks  for  our  marketable  securities denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Fair  value  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are recognized in OI&amp;E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded     component in OI&amp;E.

## Net Investment Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&amp;E.

## Other Derivatives

We  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  that  are  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  to  hedge  intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&amp;E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other derivatives are primarily reflected within the 'other' component of OI&amp;E. See Note 6 for further details.

## Offsetting of Derivatives

We enter into master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements to reduce credit risk. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets.

The gross amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting arrangements with various counterparties, and cash and non-cash collateral received and pledged under such agreements were as follows (in millions):

## Note 4. Variable Interest Entities (VIE)

## Consolidated VIEs

We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.

In July 2024, Alphabet committed to fund up to $5.0 billion for the ongoing operations of Waymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE.

Total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024,  respectively,  of  which  $1.1  billion  is  redeemable  noncontrolling  interest  (RNCI)  for  both  periods.  NCI  and  RNCI  are  included  within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the "other" component of OI&amp;E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&amp;E.

## Unconsolidated VIEs

We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources.

We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.

The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated VIEs were $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying value relates primarily to future funding commitments.

## Note 5. Debt

## Short-Term Debt

We have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024.

Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.

The notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semiannually.

The total  estimated  fair  value  of  the  outstanding  notes  was  approximately  $10.3  billion  and  $8.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2023  and June 30, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

## Credit Facility

As of June 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April 2025 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024.

## Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies

## Commitments

We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $9.7 billion as of June 30, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.

## Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  or  covenants,  or  out  of  intellectual  property  infringement  or  other  claims  made  against  certain  parties.  Several  of  these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.

It  is  not  possible  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  maximum  potential  amount  under  these  indemnification  agreements  due  to  the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

As of June 30, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.

## Legal Matters

We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.

Certain  outstanding  matters  seek  speculative,  substantial  or  indeterminate  monetary  amounts,  substantial  changes  to  our  business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.

We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.

## Antitrust Matters

On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related  complaints against us.

- On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.
- On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.

<!-- page break -->

- On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.

In  addition,  on  July  7,  2021,  a  number  of  state Attorneys  General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.

In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google . The jury found that Google violated antitrust  laws  related  to  Google  Play's  business.  Epic  did  not  seek  monetary  damages.  The  presiding  judge  will  determine  non-monetary remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We plan to appeal.

From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their nature we cannot estimate a possible loss include:

- In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further,  in  June  2022,  the  Australian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (ACCC)  and  the  United  Kingdom's  Competition  and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.
- On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust  complaint  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Virginia  alleging  that  Google's  digital  advertising  technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint. A trial is scheduled  for  September  2024.  The  EC,  the  CMA,  and  the  ACCC  each  opened  a  formal  investigation  into  Google's  advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement  of  Objections  (SO)  informing  Google  of  its  preliminary  view  that  Google  violated  European  antitrust  laws  relating  to  its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023.
- In  May  2022,  the  EC  and  the  CMA  each  opened  investigations  into  Google  Play's  business  practices.  Korean  regulators  are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.

We believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.

## Privacy Matters

We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits  ongoing  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  For  example,  there  are  ongoing  investigations  and  litigation  in  the  U.S.  and  the  European  Union, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.

## Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services,  and  technologies  infringe  others'  intellectual  property  rights.  Adverse  results  in  these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss

<!-- page break -->

of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important  forum  to  litigate  intellectual  property  disputes  because  an  ultimate  loss  in  an  ITC  action  can  result  in  a  prohibition  on  importing infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  Because  the  U.S.  is  an  important  market,  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.

Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.

## Other

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods  and  services  offered  by  advertisers  or  publishers  using  our  platforms,  personal  injury,  consumer  protection,  and  other  matters.  For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory  and  government  investigations,  and  other  proceedings  could  result  in  substantial  fines  and  penalties,  injunctive  relief,  ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon  us  in  connection  with  disputes  regarding  the  termination  of  accounts,  including  those  of  sanctioned  parties.  We  do  not  believe  these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

## Non-Income Taxes

We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of nonincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions  and  the  tax  treatment  of  certain  employee  benefits.  We  accrue  non-income  taxes  that  may  result  from  examinations  by,  or  any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be  estimated,  we  disclose  the  reasonably  possible  loss.  Due  to  the  inherent  complexity  and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.

See Note 12 for information regarding income tax contingencies.

## Note 9. Stockholders' Equity

## Share Repurchases

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased $15.6 billion and $31.7 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.

In April  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  of Alphabet  authorized  the  company  to  repurchase  up  to  $70.0  billion  of  its  Class A  and  Class  C shares. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of June 30, 2024, $74.9 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of June 30, 2024. (1)

Repurchases  are  executed  from  time  to  time,  subject  to  general  business  and  market  conditions  and  other  investment  opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

## Dividends

On April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C shares. These dividends were paid on June 17, 2024, totaling to $1.2 billion, $173 million, and $1.1 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.

The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

We  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  evaluating  our  uncertain  tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $9.4 billion and $10.7 billion, of which $7.4 billion and $8.6 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively.

## Note 13. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:

- Google  Services  includes  products  and  services  such  as  ads, Android,  Chrome,  devices,  Google  Maps,  Google  Play,  Search,  and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.
- Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration  tools,  and  other  services  for  enterprise  customers.  Google Cloud  generates  revenues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  received  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.
- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are

<!-- page break -->

managed  centrally  at  a  consolidated  level.  These  costs,  including  the  associated  depreciation  and  impairment,  are  allocated  to  operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.

As announced on April 18, 2024, we further consolidated teams that focus on building AI models across Google Research and Google DeepMind to further accelerate our progress in AI. AI model development teams previously under Google Research in our Google Services segment are included as part of Google DeepMind, reported within Alphabet-level activities, prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024.

Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&amp;D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared  costs  such  as  certain  finance,  human  resource,  and  legal  costs,  including  certain  fines  and  settlements.  Charges  associated  with employee  severance  and  office  space  reductions  during  2023  and  employee  severance  in  2024  were  also  not  allocated  to  our  segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.

Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

## ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with "Note About ForwardLooking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," as updated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results

Alphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Revenues and Monetization Metrics

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in "Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:

- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
- changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;
- general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;
- new product and service launches; and
- seasonality.

Additionally,  fluctuations  in  our  revenues  generated  from  advertising  ("Google  advertising"),  revenues  from  other  sources  ("Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.

## Google Services

Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues.

## Google Advertising

Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following:

- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their  default  search  in  browsers,  toolbars,  etc.),  and  other  Google  owned  and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and
- Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to  traffic  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties,  while  impressions  and  cost-per-impression  pertain  to  traffic  on  our Google Network properties.

<!-- page break -->

Paid clicks  represent  engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google  owned  and  operated  properties  including  Gmail,  Google  Maps,  and  Google  Play.  Cost-per-click  is  defined  as  click-driven  revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.

Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.

Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &amp; other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as:

- advertiser competition for keywords;
- changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;
- changes in device mix;
- seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and
- traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.

## Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices

Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:

- consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;
- platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;
- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and
- other products and services.

Fluctuations  in  our  Google  subscriptions,  platforms,  and  devices  revenues  have  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  affected  by  factors  in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:

- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud;
- Google  Workspace,  which  includes  subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and
- other enterprise services.

Fluctuations  in  our  Google  Cloud  revenues  have  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  affected  by  factors  in  addition  to  the  general  factors described above, such as customer usage.

## Other Bets

Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

<!-- page break -->

## Costs and Expenses

Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in particular due to annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.

## Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.

- TAC includes:
- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and
- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
- Other cost of revenues primarily includes:
- compensation expense related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content review and customer and product support;
- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  providers  from  whom  we  license  video  and  other  content  for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);
- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;
- inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and
- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including bandwidth, energy, and equipment costs.

TAC  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  generated  from  ads  placed  on  Google  Network  properties  are  significantly  higher  than  TAC  as  a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.

## Operating Expenses

Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.

The main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:

- compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&amp;D related to our existing and new products and services;
- depreciation; and
- third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts.

The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:

- compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and
- spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.

The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:

- compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions;
- expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and
- third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

OI&amp;E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.

For  additional  information,  including  how  we  account  for  our  investments  and  factors  that  can  drive  fluctuations  in  the  value  of  our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  The  provision  includes  the  effect  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are  considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

- Total constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 15% year over year.
- Cost of revenues was $35.5 billion, an increase of 11% year over year, primarily driven by increases in content acquisition costs, TAC, depreciation  expense,  digital  services  tax  related  to  the  recently  enacted  law  in  Canada,  which  is  applied  retroactively,  and  other technical infrastructure operations costs.
- Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, an increase of 5% year over year, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses, depreciation expense, and third-party services fees. The increase in compensation expenses was largely due to an increase in SBC expenses, which primarily reflects the

## Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information

International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use nonGAAP  constant  currency  revenues  ("constant  currency  revenues")  and  non-GAAP  percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.  We  believe  the  presentation  of  results  on  a  constant  currency  basis  in  addition  to  GAAP  results  helps  improve  the  ability  to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.

Constant  currency  information  compares  results  between  periods  as  if  exchange  rates  had  remained  constant  period  over  period.  We define  constant  currency  revenues  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements  ("FX  Effect")  as  well  as hedging  activities,  which  are  recognized  at  the  consolidated  level.  We  use  constant  currency  revenues  to  determine  the  constant  currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.

Constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  is  calculated  by  determining  the  change  in  current  period  revenues  over  prior  year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.

These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

The  following  table  presents  the  foreign  currency  exchange  effect  on  international  revenues  and  total  revenues  (in  millions,  except percentages):

Total constant currency revenues of $166.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $22.5 billion compared to $144.4 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. (1)

EMEA  revenue  growth  was  not  materially  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  as  the  effect  of  the  U.S.  dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira was largely offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the British pound and the Euro.

APAC  revenue  growth  was  unfavorably  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  primarily  due  to  the  U.S.  dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.

Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.

| TAC                                                | $ 12,537                      | $ 13,387                      | $ 24,258                    | $ 26,333                    |
| Other cost of revenues                             | 19,379                        | 22,120                        | 38,270                      | 42,886                      |
| Total cost of revenues                             | $ 31,916                      | $ 35,507                      | $ 62,528                    | $ 69,219                    |
| Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues | 43%                           | 42%                           | 43%                         | 42%                         |

Cost of revenues increased $3.6 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2023 to the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $2.7 billion and $850 million, respectively. Cost of revenues increased $6.7 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $4.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.

The increase in TAC from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.6% to 20.7% from the three months ended June 30, 2023 to the three months ended June 30, 2024 and decreased from 21.5% to 20.9% from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search &amp; other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search &amp; other revenues was substantially consistent from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues was substantially consistent from the three months ended June 30, 2023 to the three months ended June 30, 2024 and reflected a slight increase from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.

The increase in other cost of revenues from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, depreciation expense, digital services tax related to the recently enacted law in Canada, which is applied retroactively, and other technical infrastructure operations costs. Additionally, an increase in third-party service fees

contributed to the increase in other cost of revenues from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024.

R&amp;D expenses increased $1.3 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2023 to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven  by  increases  in  compensation  expenses  of  $585  million,  depreciation  expense  of  $331  million,  and  third-party  services  fees  of  $219 million. The increase in compensation expenses was largely due to an increase in SBC expenses of $471 million, which primarily reflects the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period.

R&amp;D expenses increased $1.7 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases in depreciation expense of $640 million, compensation expenses of $522 million, and third-party services fees of $472 million. The increase in compensation expenses was primarily related to an increase in SBC expenses of $790 million, excluding employee severance and related charges, and reflects the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period. The increase in compensation expenses is partially offset by a reduction in employee severance and related charges of $569 million.

General and administrative expenses decreased $323 million and $1.1 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by a reduction in charges related to legal matters of $471 million and $718 million, respectively, as well as a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.

In addition to the costs included in Alphabet-level activities, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue were $3 million and $102 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $87 million and $174 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, Alphabet-level activities included substantially all of the charges related to employee severance and our office space optimization efforts.

## Google Services

Google Services operating income increased $6.2 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2023 to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in content acquisition costs and TAC. Additionally, a reduction in compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income.

Google Services operating income increased $12.4 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024.  The  increase  in  operating  income  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  revenues,  partially  offset  by  increases  in  TAC  and  content acquisition costs. Additionally, a reduction in compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud operating income increased $777 million and $1.5 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in usage costs for technical infrastructure assets as well as compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth.

## Other Bets

Other Bets operating loss increased $321 million and $116 million from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses as a result of the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period. Additionally, growth in revenues partially offset the increase in operating loss from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024.

OI&amp;E increased $61 million from the three months ended June 30, 2023 to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Net unrealized losses in marketable equity securities reflecting market driven changes were offset by a decrease in unrealized losses on non-marketable equity securities from fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and increased interest income related to higher interest rates.

OI&amp;E increased $2.1 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due  to  an  increase  in  net  unrealized  gains  on  non-marketable  equity  securities  driven  by  fair  value  adjustments  related  to  observable transactions  and  increased  interest  income  related  to  higher  interest  rates.  The  increases  were  partially  offset  by  net  unrealized  losses  in marketable equity securities reflecting market driven changes.

## Provision for Income Taxes

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):

|                                          | Three Months Ended June 30,   | Three Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|                                          | 2023                          | 2024                          | 2023                        | 2024                        |
| Income before provision for income taxes | $ 21,903                      | $ 27,551                      | $ 40,108                    | $ 55,866                    |
| Provision for income taxes               | $ 3,535                       | $ 3,932                       | $ 6,689                     | $ 8,585                     |
| Effective tax rate                       | 16.1%                         | 14.3%                         | 16.7%                       | 15.4%                       |

The effective tax rate decreased from the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily  due  to  the  tax  rule  change  related  to  U.S.  federal  foreign  tax  credits  issued  by  the  IRS  in  July  2023,  an  increase  in  stock-based compensation-related tax benefits, partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction.

The OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to  international  tax  policies,  including  the  implementation  of  a  minimum  global  effective  tax  rate  of  15%.  Some  countries  have  already implemented the legislation effective  January  1,  2024,  and  we  expect  others  to  follow,  however  we  do  not  expect  a  material  change  to  our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As additional jurisdictions enact such legislation, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.

## Financial Condition

## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities

As  of  June  30,  2024,  we  had  $100.7  billion  in  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term  marketable  securities.  Cash  equivalents  and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid

<!-- page break -->

government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities.

## Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.

The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):

|                                           | Six Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|                                           | 2023                        | 2024                        |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 52,175                    | $ 55,488                    |
| Net cash used in investing activities     | $ (13,746)                  | $ (11,345)                  |
| Net cash used in financing activities     | $ (34,403)                  | $ (40,603)                  |

## Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Our  largest  source  of  cash  provided  by  operations  are  advertising  revenues  generated  by  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties,  Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app  purchases,  and  devices.  In  Google  Cloud,  we  generate  cash  through  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools, and other cloud services.

Our  primary  uses  of  cash  from  operating  activities  include  payments  to  distribution  and  Google  Network  partners,  to  employees  for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in tax payments. The increase in tax payments in comparison to the  prior  year  comparable  period  was  primarily  due  to  the  2023  IRS  payment  deferral  relief  made  available  to  taxpayers  headquartered  in designated counties in California.

## Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash  used  in  investing  activities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  purchases  of  property  and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in purchases of property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities.

## Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  consists  primarily  of  proceeds  from  issuance  of  debt  and  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  interests  in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2023 to the six months ended June 30, 2024 due to dividend payments, increases in repurchases of stock, and net payments related to stock-based award activities.

## Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities  and  cash  commitments  for  investing  and  financing  activities  for  at  least  the  next  12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

## Capital Expenditures and Leases

We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.

## Capital Expenditures

Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:

- technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and
- office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").

Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction  projects  are  generally  multi-year  projects  with  multiple  phases,  where  we  acquire  land  and  buildings,  construct  buildings,  and secure and install information technology assets.

During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, we spent $13.2 billion and $25.2 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment was $5.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.

## Leases

For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, we recognized total operating lease assets of $1.7 billion and $897 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.9 years, was $16.9 billion.

As of June 30, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $5.2 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2027 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years.

For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024.

## Financing

We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2024, we had no commercial paper outstanding.

As of June 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2028.The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.

As of June 30, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion. For additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Share Repurchase Program

<!-- page break -->

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 92 million and 203 million shares for $15.6 billion and $31.7 billion, respectively.

In April  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  of Alphabet  authorized  the  company  to  repurchase  up  to  $70.0  billion  of  its  Class A  and  Class  C shares. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of June 30, 2024, $74.9 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

## Dividend Program

On April 25, 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024, on each of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C shares. These dividends were paid on June 17, 2024, totaling to $1.2 billion, $173 million, and $1.1 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.

The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

## European Commission Fines

In  2017,  2018,  and  2019,  the  EC  announced  decisions  that  certain  actions  taken  by  Google  infringed  European  competition  law  and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March  20,  2019),  respectively.  On  September  14,  2022,  the  General  Court  reduced  the  2018  fine  from  €4.3  billion  to  €4.1  billion.  We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice.

While  each  EC  decision  is  under  appeal,  we  included  the  fines  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities  on  our  Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Taxes

As of June 30, 2024, we had short-term income taxes payable of $2.7 billion, related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable of $7.7 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2024.

## Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations

As of June 30, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $54.9 billion, of which $41.0 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of June 30, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable  energy  certificates.  These  agreements  do  not  include  a  minimum  dollar  commitment.  The  amounts  to  be  paid  under  these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.

## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and  procedures  are  designed  at  a  reasonable  assurance  level  and  are  effective  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  we  are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure  controls  and  procedures  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints  and  that  management  is  required  to  apply  its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our  operations  and  financial  results  are  subject  to  various  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  described  in  Part  I,  Item  1A,  "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

## We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.

We generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products  and  services,  digital  publishers,  and  content  providers  can  terminate  their  contracts  with  us  at  any  time.  These  partners  may  not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand  awareness,  or  more  effective  monetization)  than  their  available  alternatives.  Changes  to  our  advertising  policies  and  data  privacy practices,  such  as  our  initiatives  related  to  third-party  cookies,  including  our  recent  announcement  to  move  from  phasing  out  all  third-party cookies  to  a  proposed  user  choice  model  (which  remains  subject  to  continuing  discussions  with  regulators),  as  well  as  changes  to  other companies' advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition,  technologies  have  been  developed  that  make  customized  ads  more  difficult,  or  that  block  the  display  of  ads  altogether,  and  some providers  of  online  services  have  integrated  technologies  that  could  potentially  impair  the  availability  and  functionality  of  third-party  digital advertising.  Failing  to  provide  superior  value  or  deliver  advertisements  effectively  and  competitively  could  harm  our  business,  reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

In  addition,  expenditures  by  advertisers  tend  to  correlate  with  overall  economic  conditions.  Adverse  macroeconomic  conditions  have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.

## ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

## 10b5-1 Trading Plans

During the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, the following Section 16 officers and director adopted, modified, or terminated a 'Rule 10b51 trading arrangement' (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act):

- Prabhakar Raghavan, Senior Vice President, Knowledge and Information, Google, adopted a trading plan on May 13, 2024 (with the first trade under the plan scheduled for August 15, 2024). The trading plan will be effective until May 8, 2025 to sell an aggregate of 96,784 shares of Class C Capital Stock during the plan period.
- K.  Ram  Shriram,  independent  director,  adopted  a  trading  plan  on  May  30,  2024  (with  the  first  trade  under  the  plan  scheduled  for September 3,  2024). The  trading  plan  will  be  effective  until  September  3,  2025  to  sell  an  aggregate  of  144,266  shares  of  Class A Common Stock during the plan period.
- Amie Thuener O'Toole, Vice President, Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Officer, adopted a trading plan on May 31, 2024 (with the first trade under the plan scheduled for September 10, 2024). The trading plan will be effective until September 10, 2025 to sell an aggregate of (i) 16,996 shares of Class C Capital Stock plus (ii) 100% of the (net) shares resulting from the vesting of an additional 24,626 (gross) shares of Class C Capital Stock during the plan period (net shares are net of tax withholding).
- Kent Walker, President, Global Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, effected a trading plan modification by terminating a trading plan on May 29, 2024 that was originally adopted on May 31, 2023, and adopting a new trading plan on May 29, 2024 (with the first trade under the new plan scheduled for September 3, 2024). The new trading plan will be effective until February 27, 2027 to sell 100% of the (net) shares resulting from the vesting of 355,887 (gross) shares of Class C Capital Stock during the plan period (net shares are net of tax withholding).*

*In accordance with SEC rules adopted on December 14, 2022, any modification or change to the amount, price, or timing of the purchase or sale of securities constitutes a termination of an existing Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement and the adoption of a new Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.

There were no 'non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements' (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act) adopted, modified or  terminated  during  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  June  30,  2024  by  our  directors  and  Section  16  officers.  Each  of  the  Rule  10b5-1  trading arrangements  are  in  accordance  with  our  Policy  Against  Insider  Trading  and  actual  sale  transactions  made  pursuant  to  such  trading arrangements will be disclosed publicly in Section 16 filings with the SEC in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations.

## Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to holders of all unvested stock units, subject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors  of  the  company  (which  was  announced on July 23, 2024). As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of dividend equivalent units is intended to preserve  the  equity-based  incentives  intended  by  the  company  when  the  stock  units  were  granted  and  to  treat  the  holders  of  stock  units consistently with all stockholders.
