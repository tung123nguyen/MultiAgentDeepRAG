## Note About Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding:

- the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success and trends in our business;
- fluctuations in our revenues and margins and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
- our expectation that the continuing shift to an online world as the digital economy evolves will continue to benefit our business;
- our expectation that the revenues that we derive beyond advertising will continue to increase and may affect our margins;
- our expectation that our traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and the associated TAC rate will fluctuate, which could affect our overall margins;
- our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins;
- fluctuations in paid clicks and cost-per-click as well as impressions and cost-per-impression, and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
- our expectation that we will continue to periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the  number  of  paid  clicks  and  impressions,  and  for  identifying  the  revenues  generated  by  the  corresponding  click  and  impression activity;
- our  expectation  that  our  results  will  be  affected  by  our  performance  in  international  markets  as  users  in  developing  economies increasingly come online;
- our  expectation  that  our  foreign  exchange  risk  management  program  will  not  fully  offset  our  net  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign currency exchange rates;
- the expected variability of gains and losses related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program;
- the  amount  and  timing  of  revenue  recognition  from  customer  contracts  with  commitments  for  performance  obligations,  including  our estimate of the remaining amount of commitments and when we expect to recognize revenue;
- our expectation that our capital expenditures will increase, including our expected spend and the expected increase in our technical infrastructure  investment  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  our  long-term  initiatives,  in  particular  in  support  of  artificial intelligence (AI) products and services;
- our plans to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and systems, as well as to continue to invest in acquisitions and strategic investments;
- our pace of hiring and our plans to provide competitive compensation programs;
- our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development (R&amp;D) expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses may increase in amount and/or may increase as a percentage of revenues and may be affected by a number of factors;
- estimates of our future employee compensation expenses;
- our expectation that our other income (expense), net (OI&amp;E), will fluctuate in the future, as it is largely driven by market dynamics;
- fluctuations in our effective tax rate;
- seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;
- the sufficiency of our sources of funding;
- our potential exposure in connection with new and pending investigations, proceedings, and other contingencies, including the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results;

- our  expectation  that  we  will  continue  to  face  heightened  regulatory  scrutiny,  and  changes  in  regulatory  conditions,  laws,  and  public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results;
- the expected timing, amount, and effect of Alphabet Inc.'s share repurchases and dividends;
- our long-term sustainability goals;
- our expectations regarding the timing and successful closing and integration of the Wiz, Inc. ("Wiz") acquisition, including the realization of anticipated benefits; and
- ongoing developments surrounding international trade and the related impact on the macroeconomic environment and our business;

## Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Nature of Operations

Google  was  incorporated  in  California  in  September  1998  and  re-incorporated  in  the  State  of  Delaware  in August  2003.  In  2015,  we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all  sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscriptionbased products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.

## Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

## Unaudited Interim Financial Information

These  unaudited  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles  in  the  United  States  (GAAP),  and  in  our  opinion,  include  all  adjustments  of  a  normal  recurring  nature  necessary  for  fair  financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

These  consolidated  financial  statements  and  other  information  presented  in  this  Form  10-Q  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC.

## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard, which is effective for our 2025 annual period, can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and we are currently assessing which method to adopt.

In  November  2024,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2024-03  "Income  Statement:  Reporting  Comprehensive  Income-Expense  Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)" to improve the disclosures about an entity's expenses. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard  can  be  applied  either  prospectively  or  retrospectively.  We  are  currently  assessing  adoption  timing  and  the  effect  that  the  updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

## Prior Period Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

## Revenue Backlog

As of June 30, 2025, we had $108.2 billion of remaining performance obligations ('revenue backlog'), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.

## Deferred Revenues

We record  deferred  revenues  when  cash  payments  are  received  or  due  in  advance  of  our  performance,  including  amounts  which  are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $6.0 billion, of which $3.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of June 30, 2025 was $6.8 billion.

## Fair Value Measurements

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within

<!-- page break -->

Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.

Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&amp;E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

The following  tables  summarize  our  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  marketable  securities  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis  (in millions):

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are  classified  within  Level  2  or  Level  3  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy.  Non-marketable  equity  securities  that  have  been  remeasured  due  to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.

As of June 30, 2025, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $49.8 billion, of which $3.2 billion was remeasured at fair  value  during the three months ended June 30, 2025 and was primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.

## Equity Investments

The carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). Gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&amp;E. Certain of our non-marketable equity securities include our investments in variable interest entities (VIE) where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 5 for further details on VIE.

Unrealized gain (loss) on non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is comprised of $319 million and $660 million of upward adjustments and $745 million and $454 million of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, respectively, and $3.1 billion and $10.4 billion of upward adjustments and $1.6 billion and $853 million of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, respectively. (1)

In the table above, realized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later.

Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected  in  periods  prior  to  the  period  of  sale,  we  believe  they  are  important  supplemental  information  as  they  reflect  the economic net gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

## Equity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method

As  of  December  31,  2024  and  June  30,  2025,  equity  securities  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  had  a  carrying  value  of approximately $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&amp;E. Certain of our equity method securities include our investments in VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 5 for further details on VIEs.

## Convertible Notes

<!-- page break -->

As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, we had investments in convertible notes of $2.9 billion and $651 million, respectively. During the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2025,  we  converted  $3.0  billion  of  our  convertible  notes  into  equity  securities,  which  included  gains  from conversion of $416 million. These gains were recognized in OI&amp;E within the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&amp;E.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.

We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair  values  and  present  all  other  derivatives  at  gross  fair  values. The  accounting  treatment  for  derivatives  is  based  on  the  intended  use  and hedge designation.

## Cash Flow Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.

Cash  flow  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred  in  AOCI  and  subsequently  reclassified  to revenue  when  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in  earnings.  We  exclude  forward  points  and  time  value  from  our  assessment  of  hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.

As of June 30, 2025, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $767 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.

## Fair Value Hedges

We  designate  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  as  fair  value  hedges  to  hedge  foreign  currency  risks  for  our  marketable  securities denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Fair  value  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are recognized in OI&amp;E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded     component in OI&amp;E.

## Net Investment Hedges

We  designate  foreign  currency  forward  contracts,  option  contracts  (including  collars),  and  foreign  currency-denominated  debt  as  net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  recognized  in  AOCI  along  with  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment.  For  derivative instruments, we exclude forward points and time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&amp;E.

We had no foreign currency-denominated debt as of December 31, 2024 and $7.8 billion carrying value of foreign currency-denominated debt designated as net investment hedges as of June 30, 2025.

## Other Derivatives

We  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  that  are  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  to  hedge  intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&amp;E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other derivatives are primarily reflected within the 'other' component of OI&amp;E. See Note 7 for further details.

## Note 5. Variable Interest Entities

## Consolidated VIEs

We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $8.7 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.

As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion,  respectively,  of  which  $1.1  billion  was  redeemable  noncontrolling  interests  (RNCI)  in  each  period.  NCI  and  RNCI  are  included  within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the "other" component of OI&amp;E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&amp;E.

## Unconsolidated VIEs

We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources.

We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated  VIEs  is  generally  based  on  the  current  carrying  value  of  the  investments  and  any  future  funding  commitments.  As  of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

## Note 6. Debt

## Short-Term Debt

We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $25.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had $2.3 billion and $3.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.4% in each period. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025.

Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.

## Long-Term Debt

In May 2025, we issued $5.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $750 million of 4.00% notes  due  2030,  $1.25  billion  of  4.50%  notes  due  2035,  $1.5  billion  of  5.25%  notes  due  2055,  and  $1.5  billion  of  5.30%  notes  due  2065. Additionally in May 2025, we issued €6.75 billion of euro-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in five tranches: €1.5 billion of 2.50% notes due 2029, €1.5 billion of 3.00% notes due 2033, €1.25 billion of 3.38% notes due 2037, €1.25 billion of 3.88% notes due 2045, and €1.25 billion of 4.00% notes due 2054.

Total current portion of long-term debt is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities. See Note 7 for further details. (2)

The notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semiannually, except for the euro-denominated notes, which are payable annually.

The total  estimated  fair  value  of  the  outstanding  notes  was  approximately  $9.0  billion  and  $21.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2024  and June 30, 2025, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

## Credit Facility

As of June 30, 2025, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April 2026 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2030. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025.

## Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies

## Commitments

We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $8.2 billion as of June 30, 2025, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.

## Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or indemnify certain parties against losses arising from a breach of representations  or  covenants,  or  out  of  intellectual  property  infringement  or  other  claims  made  against  certain  parties.  Several  of  these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.

It  is  not  possible  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  maximum  potential  amount  under  these  indemnification  agreements  due  to  the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

As of June 30, 2025, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.

## Legal Matters

We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.

Certain  outstanding  matters  seek  speculative,  substantial  or  indeterminate  monetary  amounts,  substantial  changes  to  our  business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.

We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.

## Antitrust Matters

We  are  subject  to  formal  and  informal  inquiries  and  investigations  as  well  as  litigation  on  various  competition  matters  by  regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the following:

- Shopping: In  June  2017,  the  EC  announced  its  decision  that  certain  actions  taken  by  Google  relating  to  its  display  and  ranking  of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a €2.4 billion fine. In 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine.

- Android: In  July  2018,  the  EC  announced  its  decision  that  certain  provisions  in  Google's  Android-related  distribution  agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a €4.3 billion fine, and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.
- AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's agreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of €1.5 billion, and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners'  agreements,  which  we  implemented  prior  to  the  decision.  In  2019,  we  recognized  a  charge  of  $1.7  billion  for  the  fine  and appealed the EC decision. In September 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.
- Search: In  October  2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. In August  2024,  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia  ruled  that  Google  violated  such  U.S.  antitrust  laws.  A  separate proceeding  to  determine  remedies,  the  range  of  which  vary  widely,  concluded  in  May  2025.  The  DOJ's  remedy  proposal  included alterations  to  our  products  and  services  and  our  business  models  and operations, including structural remedies, and our distribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect a decision on remedies in August 2025, after which we intend to appeal the August 2024 ruling and, potentially, aspects of the remedies decision following our review of that decision.

Further,  in  June  2022,  the  Australian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  and  in  October  2023,  the  Japanese  Fair  Trade Commission (JFTC) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices. In April 2025, the JFTC issued a cease-and-desist order requiring us to make changes to our Android agreements to ensure they are consistent with Japanese antitrust law. The JFTC did not impose monetary penalties. We are constructively engaging with JFTC regarding compliance with the order.

Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.

- Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District  of  Texas  alleging  that  Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  as  well  as  state  deceptive  trade  laws  relating  to  its  advertising technology.  A  trial  will  take  place  after  a  decision  on  remedies  is  issued  in  the  following  DOJ  case  against  Google  relating  to  its advertising technology. In January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, and a number  of  additional  state Attorneys  General  subsequently  joined  the  lawsuit.  In April  2025,  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern District of Virginia issued a mixed decision in the DOJ case against Google, ruling that the DOJ failed to show that Google's advertiser tools  or  acquisitions  of  DoubleClick  and  AdMeld  were  anticompetitive,  but  that  Google's  publisher  tools  violated  antitrust  laws  by excluding rivals. A separate proceeding to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely, is scheduled to take place in September 2025. The DOJ's remedy proposal includes structural remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also filed a remedy proposal ahead of the September proceedings. After a decision on remedies, we plan to appeal the adverse portion of the April 2025 decision and, potentially, aspects of the remedies decision following our review of that decision.

Further, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European antitrust  laws  relating  to  its  advertising  technology,  to  which  we  responded.  In  September  2024,  the  UK  also  issued  a  Statement  of Objections on similar grounds, to which we responded.

Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.

- Google Play: In  July  2021,  a  number  of  state Attorneys  General  filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of California  alleging  that  Google's  operation  of Android  and  Google  Play  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  and  state  antitrust  and  consumer protection  laws.  In  September  2023,  we  reached  a  settlement  in  principle  with  50  state Attorneys  General  and  three  territories  and recognized a charge. Final approval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.

In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws related to  Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing  the  verdict  and  the  trial  court  judge  temporarily  paused  the  implementation  of  the  remedies  while  the  Court  of  Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.

- European Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's compliance with certain provisions of the European Union's (EU) Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search. In March 2025, the EC issued preliminary findings of non-compliance in both investigations, to which we responded. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.

In addition to these antitrust proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by regulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions, including across Europe. Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.

We believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.

## Privacy Matters

We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, alleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. In April 2025, we reached a $1.4 billion agreement in principle to settle certain privacy matters.

## Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services,  and  technologies  infringe  others'  intellectual  property  rights.  Adverse  results  in  these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  Because  the  U.S.  is  an  important  market,  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.

Further,  our  customers  and  partners  may  discontinue  the  use  of  our  products,  services,  and  technologies,  as  a  result  of  injunctions  or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.

## Other

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, AI training,  and  other  matters.  For  example,  we  periodically  have  data  incidents  that  we  report  to  relevant  regulators  as  required  by  law.  Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive  relief,  ongoing  monitoring  and  auditing  obligations,  changes  to  our  products  and  services,  alterations  to  our  business  models  and operations,  and  collateral  related  civil  litigation  or  other  adverse  consequences,  all  of  which  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial condition, and operating results.

We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that include compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

## Non-Income Taxes

<!-- page break -->

We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of nonincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions  and  the  tax  treatment  of  certain  employee  benefits.  We  accrue  non-income  taxes  that  may  result  from  examinations  by,  or  any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be  estimated,  we  disclose  the  reasonably  possible  loss.  Due  to  the  inherent  complexity  and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.

See Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.

## Note 11. Stockholders' Equity

## Share Repurchases

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, we repurchased $13.3 billion and $28.6 billion of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares, respectively.

In April  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  of Alphabet  authorized  the  company  to  repurchase  up  to  $70.0  billion  of  its  Class A  and  Class  C shares. In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of Class A and Class C shares. As of June 30, 2025, $86.3 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases. (1)

Repurchases  are  executed  from  time  to  time,  subject  to  general  business  and  market  conditions  and  other  investment  opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

## Dividends

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, total cash dividends were $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion for Class A, $178 million and $350 million for Class B, and $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion for Class C shares, respectively.

In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet increased the quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21 per share of outstanding Class A, Class B, and Class C shares.

The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

Not applicable for consolidated net income per share. (1)

For  the  periods  presented  above,  the  holders  of  each  class  are  entitled  to  equal  per  share  dividends  or  distributions  in  liquidation  in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc. Holders of Alphabet unvested stock units are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares.

Immaterial  differences  in  net  income  per  share  across  our  Class A,  Class  B,  and  Class  C  shares  may  arise  due  to  the  allocation  of distributed earnings, which is based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the allocation of undistributed earnings and number of shares, which is based on the weighted average shares outstanding over the periods.

## Note 13. Compensation Plans

## Stock-Based Compensation

For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, total stock-based compensation (SBC) expense was $5.9 billion and $6.0 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $5.7 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively.

## Stock-Based Award Activities

The  following  table  summarizes  the  activities  for  unvested  Alphabet  restricted  stock  units  (RSUs),  which  include  dividend  equivalents awarded to holders of unvested stock, for the six months ended June 30, 2025 (in millions, except per share amounts):

|                                  | Number of Shares   | Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value   |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Unvested as of December 31, 2024 | 299                | $ 122.77                                  |
| Granted                          | 146                | $ 175.03                                  |
| Vested                           | (89)               | $ 129.05                                  |
| Forfeited/canceled               | (17)               | $ 134.20                                  |
| Unvested as of June 30, 2025     | 339                | $ 142.94                                  |

As of June 30, 2025, there was $47.0 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.

## Note 14. Income Taxes

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):

|                                          | Three Months Ended June 30,   | Three Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   |

| Income before provision for income taxes | $ 27,551                      | $ 33,933                      | $ 55,866                    | $ 75,722                    |
| Provision for income taxes               | $ 3,932                       | $ 5,737                       | $ 8,585                     | $ 12,986                    |
| Effective tax rate                       | 14.3%                         | 16.9%                         | 15.4%                       | 17.1%                       |

We  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  evaluating  our  uncertain  tax positions  and  determining  our  provision  for  income  taxes. The  total  amount  of  gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was  $12.6  billion  and  $12.9 billion, of which $10.0 billion and $11.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively.

On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law. This legislation includes changes to U.S. federal tax law, which may be subject to further clarification and the issuance of interpretive guidance. We are assessing the legislation and its effect on our consolidated financial statements, which we expect to begin reflecting in the three month period ended September 30, 2025.

## Note 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:

- Google  Services  includes  products  and  services  such  as  ads, Android,  Chrome,  devices,  Google  Maps,  Google  Play,  Search,  and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.
- Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates  revenues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  received  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  services,  Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.

<!-- page break -->

- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of autonomous transportation services, healthcare-related services and internet services.

Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.

Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include certain AIfocused shared R&amp;D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions are also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.

Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses segment operating income (loss)  to  allocate  resources  to  our  segments  in  our  annual  planning  process  and  to  assess  the  performance  of  our  segments,  primarily  by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

The following table presents revenue, profitability, and expense information about our segments (in millions):

## ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with "Note About ForwardLooking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."

## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results

Alphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Revenues and Monetization Metrics

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all  sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscriptionbased products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in "Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:

- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
- changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;
- general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;
- new product, service, and market launches; and
- seasonality.

Additionally,  fluctuations  in  our  revenues  generated  from  advertising  ("Google  advertising"),  other  sources  ("Google  subscriptions, platforms, and devices"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.

## Google Services

Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues.

## Google Advertising

Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following:

- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their  default  search  in  browsers,  toolbars,  etc.),  and  other  Google  owned  and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and
- Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to  traffic  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties,  while  impressions  and  cost-per-impression  pertain  to  traffic  on  our Google Network properties.

<!-- page break -->

Paid clicks  represent  engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google  owned  and  operated  properties  including  Gmail,  Google  Maps,  and  Google  Play.  Cost-per-click  is  defined  as  click-driven  revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.

Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.

Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &amp; other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as:

- advertiser competition for keywords;
- changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery, or policy;
- changes in device mix;
- seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and
- traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.

## Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices

Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:

- consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;
- platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;
- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and
- other products and services.

Fluctuations  in  our  Google  subscriptions,  platforms,  and  devices  revenues  have  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  affected  by  factors  in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and the timing of product launches.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:

- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud: cybersecurity; and data and analytics;
- Google  Workspace,  which  includes  subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and
- other enterprise services.

Fluctuations  in  our  Google  Cloud  revenues  have  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  affected  by  factors  in  addition  to  the  general  factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.

## Other Bets

Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of autonomous transportation services, healthcare-related services, and internet services.

## Costs and Expenses

Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount due to factors such as annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.

## Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.

- TAC includes:
- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and
- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
- Other cost of revenues primarily includes:
- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  providers  from  whom  we  license  video  and  other  content  for distribution,  primarily  related  to  YouTube  (we  pay  fees  to  these  content  providers  based  on  revenues  generated,  subscriber counts, or a flat fee);
- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;
- employee  compensation  expenses  related  to  our  technical  infrastructure  and  other  operations  such  as  content  review  and customer and product support;
- inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and
- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.

TAC  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  generated  from  ads  placed  on  Google  Network  properties  are  significantly  higher  than  TAC  as  a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.

## Operating Expenses

Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.

The main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:

- depreciation;
- employee  compensation  expenses  for  engineering  and  technical  employees  responsible  for  R&amp;D  related  to  our  existing  and  new products and services; and
- third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts.

The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:

- employee  compensation  expenses  for  employees  engaged  in  sales  and  marketing,  sales  support,  and  certain  customer  service functions; and
- spend relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.

The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:

- employee compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions;
- expenses relating to legal and other matters, including certain fines and settlements; and

<!-- page break -->

- third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

OI&amp;E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.

For  additional  information,  including  how  we  account  for  our  investments  and  factors  that  can  drive  fluctuations  in  the  value  of  our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  The  provision  includes  the  effect  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are  considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 as well as Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Google Services

## Google advertising revenues

## Google Search &amp; other

Google Search &amp; other revenues increased $5.7 billion and $10.2 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in  user  adoption  and  usage  on  mobile  devices;  growth  in  advertiser  spending;  and  improvements  we  have  made  in  ad  formats  and delivery.

## YouTube ads

YouTube ads revenues increased $1.1 billion and $2.0 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. The growth was driven by our direct response advertising products followed by our brand advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers.

## Google Network

Google Network revenues decreased $90 million from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a decrease in AdSense and Google Ad Manager revenues, partially offset by an increase in AdMob revenues.

Google Network revenues decreased $247 million from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a decrease in Google Ad Manager revenues and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in AdSense revenues.

## Monetization Metrics

The following  table  presents  changes  in  monetization  metrics  for  Google  Search  &amp;  other  revenues  (paid  clicks  and  cost-per-click)  and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a percentage, from three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to three and six months ended June 30, 2025:

| Paid clicks change         | 4%                                 | 3%                               |
| Cost-per-click change      | 8%                                 | 8%                               |
| Google Network             |                                    |                                  |
| Impressions change         | (6)%                               | (5)%                             |
| Cost-per-impression change | 6%                                 | 5%                               |

Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.

Changes  in  cost-per-click  and  cost-per-impression  are  driven  by  a  number  of  interrelated  factors  including  changes  in  device  mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

## Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices

Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscription revenues. This increase was primarily due to the contribution from growth in paid subscriptions across both YouTube services and Google One.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud revenues increased $3.3 billion and $6.0 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 primarily driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform largely from infrastructure services.

## Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information

International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use nonGAAP  constant  currency  revenues  ("constant  currency  revenues")  and  non-GAAP  percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.  We  believe  the  presentation  of  results  on  a  constant  currency  basis  in  addition  to  GAAP  results  helps  improve  the  ability  to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.

Constant  currency  information  compares  results  between  periods  as  if  exchange  rates  had  remained  constant  period  over  period.  We define  constant  currency  revenues  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements  ("FX  Effect")  as  well  as hedging  activities,  which  are  recognized  at  the  consolidated  level.  We  use  constant  currency  revenues  to  determine  the  constant  currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.

Constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  is  calculated  by  determining  the  change  in  current  period  revenues  over  prior  year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.

These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Total constant currency revenues of $96.0 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2025 increased $11.4 billion compared to $84.6 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the three months ended June 30, 2024. (1)

EMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the euro and British pound.

APAC revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Japanese yen, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the South Korean won and Australian dollar.

Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real and Mexican peso.

EMEA  revenue  growth  was  not  materially  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  as  the  effect  of  the  U.S.  dollar weakening relative to the British pound was largely offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira.

APAC  revenue  growth  was  unfavorably  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  primarily  due  to  the  U.S.  dollar strengthening relative to the Australian dollar, South Korean won, and Indian rupee.

Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real and Mexican peso.

## Cost of Revenues

The following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):

|                                                    | Three Months Ended June 30,   | Three Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|

| TAC                                                | $ 13,387                      | $ 14,705                      | $ 26,333                    | $ 28,453                    |
| Other cost of revenues                             | 22,120                        | 24,334                        | 42,886                      | 46,947                      |
| Total cost of revenues                             | $ 35,507                      | $ 39,039                      | $ 69,219                    | $ 75,400                    |
| Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues | 42%                           | 41%                           | 42%                         | 40%                         |

Cost of revenues increased $3.5 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $2.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Cost of revenues increased $6.2 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $4.1 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.

The increase in TAC from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 20.7% to 20.6% from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025 and decreased from 20.9% to 20.6% from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search &amp; other properties partially offset by an increase in the Google Search &amp; other TAC rate. The TAC rate on Google Search &amp; other revenues increased from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues was substantially consistent from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025 and decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.

The increase in other cost of revenues from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025  was  primarily  due  to  increases  in  content  acquisition  costs,  largely  for  YouTube,  depreciation  expense,  and  certain  app  and  platform distribution costs.

Google Services operating income increased $3.4 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in expenses related to legal and other matters, TAC, and content acquisition costs.

Google Services operating income increased $8.2 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in TAC and content acquisition costs.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud operating income increased $1.7 billion and $2.9 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in usage costs for technical infrastructure and employee compensation expenses.

## Other Bets

<!-- page break -->

Other Bets operating loss increased $112 million and $318 million from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, respectively. The increase in operating loss was due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.

OI&amp;E, net increased $2.5 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025 primarily due to an increase in net gains on equity and debt securities. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on equity securities resulting from market-driven changes and fair value adjustments related to observable transactions, and increased net gains on debt securities due to lower market interest rates.

OI&amp;E, net increased $10.9 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on equity securities resulting from fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and market-driven changes.

## Provision for Income Taxes

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):

|                                          | Three Months Ended June 30,   | Three Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|                                          | 2024                          | 2025                          | 2024                        | 2025                        |
| Income before provision for income taxes | $ 27,551                      | $ 33,933                      | $ 55,866                    | $ 75,722                    |
| Provision for income taxes               | $ 3,932                       | $ 5,737                       | $ 8,585                     | $ 12,986                    |
| Effective tax rate                       | 14.3%                         | 16.9%                         | 15.4%                       | 17.1%                       |

The effective tax rate increased from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, and a non-deductible legal settlement in the U.S., partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions.

The effective tax rate increased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, lower effective tax rate impacts in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction, and a non-deductible legal settlement in the U.S., partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions.

On July 4, 2025, the OBBBA was signed into law. This legislation includes changes to U.S. federal tax law, which may be subject to further clarification and the issuance of interpretive guidance. We are assessing the legislation and its effect on our consolidated financial statements, which we expect to begin reflecting in the three month period ended September 30, 2025.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies,

<!-- page break -->

including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect others to follow, however this did not have a material effect on our income tax provision for the period ending June 30, 2025.

## Financial Condition

## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities

As  of  June  30,  2025,  we  had  $95.1  billion  in  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term  marketable  securities.  Cash  equivalents  and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgagebacked and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities.

## Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.

The following table presents cash flows (in millions):

|                                           | Six Months Ended June 30,   | Six Months Ended June 30,   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|                                           | 2024                        | 2025                        |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 55,488                    | $ 63,897                    |
| Net cash used in investing activities     | $ (11,345)                  | $ (40,738)                  |
| Net cash used in financing activities     | $ (40,603)                  | $ (26,033)                  |

## Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Our  largest  source  of  cash  provided  by  operations  are  advertising  revenues  generated  by  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties,  Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app  purchases,  and  devices.  In  Google  Cloud,  we  generate  cash  through  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud services.

Our  primary  uses  of  cash  from  operating  activities  include  payments  to  distribution  and  Google  Network  partners,  to  employees  for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses and an increase in income tax payments.

## Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash  used  in  investing  activities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  purchases  of  property  and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025 primarily due to a decrease in maturities and sales of marketable securities and an increase in purchases of property and equipment primarily driven by investments in technical infrastructure.

## Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  consists  primarily  of  proceeds  from  issuance  of  debt  and  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  interests  in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025 due to an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments.

<!-- page break -->

## Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities  and  cash  commitments  for  investing  and  financing  activities  for  at  least  the  next  12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

## Capital Expenditures and Leases

We make investments in land, buildings, and servers and network equipment through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.

## Capital Expenditures

Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:

- technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, and data center land and building construction; and
- office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").

Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including assets in the process of construction or assembly, and consists primarily of technical infrastructure. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install servers and network equipment.

During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, we spent $25.2 billion and $39.6 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when such assets are ready for our intended use. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, depreciation on property and equipment was $7.1 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively.

## Leases

As of June 30, 2025, the amount of total future lease payments under operating and finance leases was $17.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.

As  of  June  30,  2025,  we  have  entered  into  leases  primarily  related  to  data  centers  that  have  not  yet  commenced  with  future  lease payments of $23.9 billion. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2031 with non-cancelable lease terms between one and 25 years.

For additional information on leases, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Financing

We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $25.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2025, we had $3.0 billion of short-term commercial paper outstanding.

In May 2025, we issued $5.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $750 million of 4.00% notes  due  2030,  $1.25  billion  of  4.50%  notes  due  2035,  $1.5  billion  of  5.25%  notes  due  2055,  and  $1.5  billion  of  5.30%  notes  due  2065. Additionally in May 2025, we issued €6.75 billion of euro-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in five tranches: €1.5 billion of 2.50% notes due 2029, €1.5 billion of 3.00% notes due 2033, €1.25 billion of 3.38% notes due 2037, €1.25 billion of 3.88% notes due 2045, and €1.25 billion of 4.00% notes due 2054. The net proceeds from all notes issued in May 2025 are used for general corporate purposes.

As of June 30, 2025, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $24.6 billion.

As of June 30, 2025, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2026 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2030. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.

For additional information, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

<!-- page break -->

We primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Share Repurchase Program

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, we repurchased and subsequently retired 81 million and 164 million shares for $13.3 billion and $28.6 billion, respectively.

In April  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  of Alphabet  authorized  the  company  to  repurchase  up  to  $70.0  billion  of  its  Class A  and  Class  C shares. In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of Class A and Class C shares. As of June 30, 2025, $86.3 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

|                             | Three Months Ended June 30, 2025   | Three Months Ended June 30, 2025   | Six Months Ended June 30, 2025   | Six Months Ended June 30, 2025   |

| Class A share repurchases   | 16                                 | $ 2,537                            | 31                               | $ 5,303                          |
| Class C share repurchases   | 65                                 | 10,726                             | 133                              | 23,261                           |
| Total share repurchases (1) | 81                                 | $ 13,263                           | 164                              | $ 28,564                         |

Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases. (1)

For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Dividend Program

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, total cash dividends were $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion for Class A, $178 million and $350 million for Class B, and $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion for Class C shares, respectively.

In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet increased the quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21 per share of outstanding Class A, Class B, and Class C shares.

The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

## European Commission Fines

In 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively.

In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending.

In  September 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.

We included the outstanding EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Taxes

As of June 30, 2025, we had long-term income taxes payable of $10.0 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions.

## Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations

<!-- page break -->

As of June 30, 2025, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $72.5 billion, of which $51.0 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of June 30, 2025. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment  from  our  suppliers.  For  more  information  related  to  our  content  licenses,  see  Note  10  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable  energy  certificates.  These  agreements  do  not  include  a  minimum  dollar  commitment.  The  amounts  to  be  paid  under  these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.

We may experience increases in the costs associated with our purchase commitments and other contractual obligations as a result of ongoing developments surrounding international trade. For details on risks related to our manufacturing and supply chain and other risks, refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.

## Pending Acquisition

In March 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wiz, a leading cloud security platform, for $32.0 billion, subject to closing adjustments, in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition of Wiz is expected to close in 2026, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and  procedures  are  designed  at  a  reasonable  assurance  level  and  are  effective  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  we  are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure  controls  and  procedures  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints  and  that  management  is  required  to  apply  its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
