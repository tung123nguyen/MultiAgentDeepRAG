As of June 28, 2024, the aggregate market value of shares held by non-affiliates of the registrant (based upon the closing sale prices of such shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 28, 2024) was approximately $2.0 trillion. For purposes of calculating the aggregate market value of shares held by non- affiliates, we have assumed that all outstanding shares are held by non-affiliates, except for shares held by each of our executive officers, directors, and 5% or greater stockholders.

These assumptions should not be deemed to constitute an admission that all executive officers, directors, and 5% or greater stockholders are, in fact, affiliates of our company, or that there are not other persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of our company. Further information concerning shareholdings of our officers, directors, and principal stockholders is included or incorporated by reference in Part III, Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## PART I

## ITEM 1. BUSINESS

## Overview

As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, "Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one." That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, an AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.

Alphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Supporting these businesses, we have centralized certain AI-related research and development which is reported in Alphabet-level activities. Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.

## Access and Technology for Everyone

The  Internet  is  one  of  the  world's  most  powerful  equalizers;  it  propels  ideas,  people,  and  businesses  large  and  small.  Our  mission  to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done.

We are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn  something  new  and  helps  support  the  creator  economy  through  the  YouTube  Partner  Program.  Google  Cloud  helps  customers  solve today's business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products  and  features  to  help  our  users,  partners,  customers,  and  communities  and  have  invested  more  than  $150  billion  in  research  and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.

## Making AI Helpful for Everyone

We believe AI is a profound platform shift, one that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across the world, and to our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a decade and making them available to our users.

In  2023,  we  took  a  significant  step  on  our  journey  to  make AI  more  helpful  for  everyone  with  the  introduction  of  Gemini,  our  natively multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image, and video. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and services that are helping people everyday. Today, all seven of our two billion-user products - Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and YouTube - are using Gemini.

Our Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at the forefront of innovation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI development platform, world-class models, as well as assistive agents and applications.

We  believe  AI  has  the  potential  to  solve  important  societal,  scientific,  and  engineering  challenges.  For  example,  in  2020,  Google DeepMind's AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we introduced AlphaFold 3, built on the previous models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in life's processes.

We are focused on transforming our products to provide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we deliver on our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

## Deliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI

We aim to  build  the  most  advanced,  safe,  and  responsible AI  through  a  full  stack  of  robust AI-optimized  infrastructure,  including  data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.

We are driving efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improvements. For example, since we started serving AI  Overviews  to  our  users,  we  have  significantly  lowered  machine  costs  and  latency  through  hardware,  engineering,  and  technical breakthroughs. Our AI-optimized infrastructure allows us to use, and offer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).

Our teams across Alphabet leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and announced, to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes,  including  Project Astra,  which  explores  the  future  capabilities  of  a  universal AI  assistant  and  Project  Mariner,  an  early  prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as an experimental extension.

We believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles.

## Enable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud

AI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on making it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means  providing  advanced  computing  infrastructure  and  expanding  access  to  Google's  latest  AI  models.  Our  Vertex  AI  platform  gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generative AI models. Gemini for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist developers to write, document, test, and operate software as well as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.

## Improve Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity

As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to provide our users the most helpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down concepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a video and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps users understand complex information by summarizing sources and providing relevant quotes. We are embedding the power of generative AI to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, the Gemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Additionally, we are using Gemini to improve recommendations on YouTube. We also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses - and we

<!-- page break -->

make that even easier with AI. For example, advertisers are able to use our updated image generation in Google Ads to produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns, and Demand Gen helps them reach their target audiences.

## Build the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices

Over the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built with Gemini Nano, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as Gemini on Pixel, Pixel Screenshots, and Pixel Studio. Our Android and Chrome operating systems enable users to access Gemini, and other Google AI features throughout their day. For example, with Circle to Search built directly into the Android experience, users can search anything they see on their phone using a simple gesture.

## Moonshots

Many companies get comfortable  doing  what  they  have  always  done,  making  only  incremental  changes.  This  incrementalism  leads  to irrelevance  over  time,  especially  in  technology,  where  change  tends  to  be  revolutionary,  not  evolutionary.  Our  acquisitions  of  YouTube  and Android and subsequent launch of Chrome have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. In  Other  Bets,  our  fully  autonomous  driving  technology  company,  Waymo,  is  now  providing  fully  autonomous,  paid  ride-hailing  services  to customers in multiple cities.

Our early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the application of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As we said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, highreward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success.

## Privacy and Security

We make it  a  priority  to  protect  the  privacy  and  security  of  our  products,  users,  and  customers,  even  if  there  are  near-term  financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, applying privacy technologies like on-device processing, giving people tools to control their experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password security features.

## Google

For reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.

## Google Services

## Serving Our Users

We have always  been  committed  to  building  helpful  products  that  can  improve  the  lives  of  millions  of  people  worldwide.  Our  product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world.

Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. While Google Search started as  a  way  to  find  web  pages,  organized  into  ten  blue  links,  we  have  driven  technical  advancements  and  product  innovations  that  have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. We first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller screens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple content types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search modalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which  lets  people  search  with  text  and  images  at  the  same  time.  Large  language  models  have  made  it  possible  to  express  more  natural language queries, vastly improving the types of questions users can ask, and the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to find what they are looking for. We are now using Gemini customized for Google Search to provide our users an improved Search experience, and AI Overviews has been released in more than one hundred countries, reaching more than one billion users.

This  drive  to  make  information  more  accessible  and  helpful  has  led  us  over  the  years  to  improve  the  discovery  and  creation  of  digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music,

<!-- page break -->

reading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content.

Fueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to invest in platforms like our Android  mobile  operating  system,  Chrome  browser,  and  Chrome  operating  system,  as  well  as  our  family  of  devices.  We  see  tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, such as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and services that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.

## How We Make Money

We have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats, and we  aim  to  ensure  positive  user  experiences  by  serving  the  right  ads  at  the  right  time  and  by  building  deep  partnerships  with  brands  and agencies. AI has been foundational to our advertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.

Google Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search &amp; other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties ("Google Network properties"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.

- Performance  advertising creates  and  delivers  relevant  ads  that  users  will  click  on  leading  to  direct  engagement  with  advertisers. Performance  advertising  lets  our  advertisers  connect  with  users  while  driving  measurable  results.  Our  ads  tools  allow  performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.
- Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.

We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.

In addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising, including:

- consumer  subscriptions, which  primarily  include  revenues  from  YouTube  services,  such  as  YouTube  TV,  YouTube  Music  and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;
- platforms , which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; and
- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.

## Google Cloud

Through  our  Google  Cloud  Platform  and  Google  Workspace  offerings,  Google  Cloud  generates  revenues  primarily  from  consumptionbased fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud services. Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways such as:

- AI-optimized  Infrastructure: provides  open,  reliable,  and  scalable  compute,  networking,  and  storage  to  enable  customers  to  run workloads anywhere - on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be used to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models.
- Developer  Platform: provides  developers,  through  the  Vertex  AI  platform,  the  ability  to  train,  tune,  augment,  test,  and  deploy applications using Gemini and other leading generative AI models. We offer widely used first-party, third-party, and open models along with services such as vector search, grounding, and distillation to further improve the cost and quality of models.
- Cybersecurity: provides AI powered cybersecurity solutions to help customers analyze, detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack paths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.

<!-- page break -->

- Data and Analytics: provides a variety of different types of databases - relational, key-value, and in-memory - to store and manage data for different types of applications and deliver data to AI agents. Our data platform also unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that helps users analyze data using AI models across any cloud.
- Applications: offers a broad applications portfolio, including Gemini for Google Cloud and Gemini for Google Workspace, as well as purpose-built agents for Search and our Customer Engagement Suite. AI has been used in Google Workspace for years to improve grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart Reply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Now, Gemini for Google Workspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.

## Other Bets

Across Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries, including transportation and  health  technology. Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  businesses  that  are  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside  investors.  While  these  early-stage  businesses  naturally  come  with  considerable  uncertainty,  some  of  them  are  already  generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services, and internet services.

## Competition

Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including but not limited to, from:

- general purpose search engines and information services;
- vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries on topics such as those related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may navigate directly to rather than go through Google;
- online advertising platforms and networks, including online shopping and streaming services;
- other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;
- digital content and application platform providers;
- providers of enterprise cloud services;
- developers and providers of AI products and services;
- companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms;
- providers of digital video services;
- social  networks,  which  users  may  rely  on  for  product  or  service  referrals,  rather  than  seeking  information  through  traditional  search engines;
- providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and
- digital assistant providers.

Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:

- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;
- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and
- content  providers,  primarily  based  on  the  quality  of  our  advertiser  base,  our  ability  to  help  these  partners  generate  revenues  from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.

## Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability

Our environmental strategy has two key pillars, supported by our dedication to accessible information and technological innovation:

- Our products: We are empowering people with information about the environmental impacts of their choices.
- Our operations: We are working to drive sustainability and efficiency across our operations and value chain.

Through our products, we have an aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030.

In 2021, we set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. To make progress toward this effort, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute emissions (compared to our 2019 base year) by 2030, and we plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.

Our primary approach to reducing our Scope 2 emissions is through the procurement of carbon-free energy (CFE). In 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 CFE every hour of every day on every grid where we operate by 2030. In 2023, we began implementing our carbon removals strategy, and we have begun establishing impactful partnerships and have started contracting for carbon removal credits.

Achieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path to net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. Our approach will continue to evolve and will require us to navigate significant uncertainty, including the uncertainty around the  future  environmental  impact  of AI,  which  is  complex  and  difficult  to  predict.  In  addition,  solutions  for  some  key  global  challenges  do  not currently  exist,  and  will  depend  heavily  on  the  development  and  improvement  of  new  technologies  by  us  and  by  the  energy  sector. As  our business and industry continue to evolve, we expect our total GHG emissions to rise before dropping toward our absolute emissions reduction target.

For additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our work on sustainability and efficiency, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Culture and Workforce

We are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.

Our people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees can have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and perform at a high level. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and development, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain key talent, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality training and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities--ranging from courses for new managers, to learning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.

As of December 31, 2024, Alphabet had 183,323 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain  countries,  and  we  are  committed  to  supporting  protected  labor  rights,  maintaining  an  open  culture,  and  listening  to  all  employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and we communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.

When appropriate we partner with outside companies on a contractual basis to provide a specialized service or to temporarily cover a shortterm need. The employees of our suppliers and staffing partners - vendors and temporary staff, respectively - and independent contractors who are self-employed, make up our extended workforce. We choose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google's Supplier Code of Conduct.

## Government Regulation

We are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects,  and  the  scope  of  this  coverage  continues  to  broaden  with  continuing  new  legal  and  regulatory  developments  in  the  U.S.  and internationally.  Like  other  companies  in  the  technology  industry,  we  face  increasingly  heightened  scrutiny  from  both  U.S.  and  foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and

<!-- page break -->

regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain. Particularly  with  regard  to  AI;  competition;  consumer  protection;  content  moderation;  data  privacy  and  security;  news  publications;  and sustainability and other social matters, we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement actions and investigations, being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the world. As we have seen  in  recent  years,  different  laws  and  regulations  on  the  same  topic  may  not  always  have  the  same  requirements,  and  even  when requirements overlap, the rules are not always consistently implemented, interpreted, and enforced from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer certain products and services, cause  us  to  change  our  business  models  and  operations,  affect  our  competitive  position  relative  to  our  peers,  and/or  otherwise  harm  our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors; Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Intellectual Property

We rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our  brand.  We  have  registered,  and  applied  for  the  registration  of,  U.S.  and  international  trademarks,  service  marks,  domain  names,  and copyrights.  We  have  also  filed  patent  applications  in  the  U.S.  and  foreign  countries  covering  certain  of  our  technology,  and  acquired  patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties. For additional information, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.

## Risks Specific to our Company

## We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to personalize ads could harm our business.

We generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2024. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products  and  services,  digital  publishers,  and  content  providers  can  terminate  their  contracts  with  us  at  any  time.  These  partners  may  not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective

<!-- page break -->

monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as our initiatives related to third-party cookies, including our announcement in July 2024 to move from phasing out all third-party cookies to a proposed user choice model (which  remains  subject  to  continuing  discussions  with  regulators),  as  well  as  changes  to  other  companies'  advertising  and/or  data  privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising services that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make personalized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

In  addition,  expenditures  by  advertisers  tend  to  correlate  with  overall  economic  conditions.  Adverse  macroeconomic  conditions  have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.

## We face  intense  competition.  If  we  do  not  continue  to  innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that  are  useful  to  users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver  innovative,  relevant  and  useful  products,  services,  and  technologies  in  a  timely  manner. As  our  businesses  evolve,  the  competitive pressure  to  innovate  will  encompass  a  wider  range  of  products  and  services.  We  must  continue  to  invest  significant  resources  in  technical infrastructure and R&amp;D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services.

We have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering  into  other  strategic  arrangements;  continuing  to  invest  heavily  in  technical  infrastructure,  R&amp;D,  and  in  talent;  initiating  intellectual property  and  competition  claims  (whether  or  not  meritorious);  and  continuing  to  compete  for  users,  advertisers,  customers,  and  content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without  commensurate  scrutiny,  thereby  affording  them  competitive  advantages.  Our  competitors  may  also  be  able  to  innovate  and  provide products and services faster or more cost effectively than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before we do.

We are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to integrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and require significant investment, including technical infrastructure, development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new users.  Our  ability  to  deploy  certain AI  technologies  critical  for  our  products  and  services  and  for  our  business  strategy  may  depend  on  the availability  and  pricing  of  third-party  equipment  and  other  technical  infrastructure  operations  costs,  including  network  capacity,  energy,  and equipment costs. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and/or deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI products and services.

Our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive in a timely manner to the evolving  needs  and  desires  of  our  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content  providers,  or  if  we  miscalculate  those  needs  and desires  and  invest  significantly  in  areas  that  fail  to  gain  sufficient  market  traction.  As  new  and  existing  technologies  continue  to  develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These  technologies  could  reduce  usage  of  our  products  and  services,  and  force  us  to  compete  in  different  ways  and  expend  significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors' success in providing compelling products and services or in  attracting  and  retaining  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content  providers  could  harm  our  financial  condition  and  operating results.

## Our  ongoing  investment  in  new  businesses,  products,  services,  and  technologies  is  inherently  risky,  and  could  divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses, such

<!-- page break -->

as building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities.

We  have  invested  significantly  and  expect  to  continue  to  invest  significantly  in  our  property  and  equipment,  including  our  technical infrastructure, and we expect these assets to benefit our business over their estimated useful lives. Changes in facts and circumstances such as changes  to  ongoing  business  operations,  changes  in  the  planned  use  and  utilization  of  assets,  and/or  technological  advancements,  could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the asset and impact our financial condition and operating results.

Innovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends. These endeavors involve  significant  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  diversion  of  resources  and  management  attention  from  current  operations,  different monetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.

Within Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide devices that compete effectively.

Within Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to support these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing, including platform switching costs, are challenging across the industry, and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and we may therefore not achieve our business objectives. Further, our business with financial services, healthcare, and public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.

Within Other Bets, we are investing significantly in areas such as health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.

In addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges,  which  may  negatively  affect  our  brands  and  demand  for  our  products  and  services.  Because  all  of  these  investment  areas  are inherently  risky,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  such  strategies  and  offerings  will  be  successful  or  will  not  harm  our  reputation,  financial condition, and operating results.

## Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.

Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the devices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines in advertiser spending; competition; changes in customer usage and demand for our existing products and increasing demand for new technologies; decreases in the pricing of our products and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.

In addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs

<!-- page break -->

for many aspects of our business, including higher level of investment in technical infrastructure. Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also not be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.

Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of  our  control  pose  a  threat  to  our  intellectual  property  rights,  as  well  as  to  our  products,  services,  and  technologies.  For  example,  effective intellectual  property  protection  may  not  be  available  in  every  country  in  which  our  products  and  services  are  distributed  or  made  available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent  protection  for  our  innovations,  it  is  possible  we  may  not  be  able  to  protect  some  of  these  innovations.  Moreover,  we  may  not  have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.

We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could  be  compromised,  which  could  cause  us  to  lose  the  competitive  advantage  resulting  from  these  trade  secrets.  We  also  face  risks associated  with  our  trademarks.  For  example,  there  is  a  risk  that  the  word  'Google'  could  become  so  commonly  used  that  it  becomes synonymous with  the  word  'search.'  Some  courts  have  ruled  that  "Google"  is  a  protectable  trademark,  but  it  is  possible  that  other  courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word 'Google' to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.

Any  significant  impairment  of  our  intellectual  property  rights  could  harm  our  business  and  our  ability  to  compete. Also,  protecting  our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.

## Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.

Our  strong  brands  have  significantly  contributed  to  the  success  of  our  business.  Maintaining  and  enhancing  the  brands  within  Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.

Furthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our  success  will  depend  largely  on  our  ability  to  remain  a  technology  leader  and  continue  to  provide  high-quality,  trustworthy,  innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings.

## We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

We face  a  number  of  risks  related  to  manufacturing  and  supply  chain  management,  which  could  affect  our  ability  to  supply  both  our products and our services.

We rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices as well as servers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to supply components and distribute our products and  services.  Our  business  could  be  negatively  affected  if  we  are  not  able  to  engage  these  companies  with  the  necessary  capabilities  or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.

<!-- page break -->

We have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, and/or longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material and/or component availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced labor concerns, sustainability sourcing requirements, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire  prevention,  and  increased  storm  severity),  power  and  transmission  availability,  and  significant  changes  in  the  financial  or  business condition of our suppliers. Some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability.

We may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements,  if  the  volume  of  sales  of  our  devices  decreases  or  does  not  reach  projected  targets,  we  could  face  increased  materials  and manufacturing  costs  or  other  financial  liabilities  that  could  make  our  products  more  costly  per  unit  to  manufacture  and  harm  our  financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply. For example, industry supply capacity for AI accelerators, including Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs, as well as our custom-built TPUs, is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. If we are unable to negotiate favorable contractual terms or our competitors claim the supply or capacity first, we may face supply constraints.

Our devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective or require a recall, it could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions,  canceled  orders,  harm  to  key  relationships,  and  damage  to  our  reputation.  Their  failure  to  procure  necessary  license  rights  to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.

## Interruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the  effects  of  climate  change  (such  as  sea  level  rise,  drought,  flooding,  heat  waves,  wildfires  and  resultant  air  quality  effects  and  power shutdowns associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power and transmission availability challenges, utility outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, cyber attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and may contain  in  the  future,  errors  or  vulnerabilities,  which  could  result  in  interruptions  in  or  failure  of  our  services  or  systems. Any  of  these incidents  could  impede  or  prevent  us  from  effectively  offering  products  and  providing  services,  which  could  harm  our  business,  reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

## Our  international  operations  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and operating results.

<!-- page break -->

Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2024. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:

- restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;
- sanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, changes in regimes, or armed conflict  (such  as  ongoing  conflicts  in  the  Middle  East  and  Ukraine),  any  of  which  may  affect  our  business  continuity,  increase  our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services, limit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain jurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;
- longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;
- an  evolving  foreign  policy  landscape  that  could  harm  our  revenues  and  could  subject  us  to  litigation,  new  regulatory  costs  and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;
- anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and
- different  employee/employer  relationships;  different  labor  laws,  regulations,  and  labor  practices;  and  other  challenges  caused  by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity of doing business in multiple jurisdictions.

Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we have faced, and will continue  to  face,  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  Although  we  hedge  a  portion  of  our  international  currency exposure,  significant  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  between  the  U.S.  dollar  and  foreign  currencies  have  in  the  past  and  may  in  the  future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.

## We are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial statements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies.

The fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.

We  measure  certain  of  our  non-marketable  equity  and  debt  securities,  certain  other  instruments  including  stock-based  compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&amp;E, which increases the volatility of our OI&amp;E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from  fair  value  remeasurements  in  any  particular  period  may  differ  significantly  from  the  gains  and  losses  we  ultimately  realize  on  such investments.

As a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.

## Risks Related to our Industry

## People  access  our  products  and  services  through  a  variety  of  platforms  and  devices  that  continue  to  evolve  with  the advancement of  technology  and  user  preferences.  If  manufacturers  and  users  do  not  widely  adopt  versions  of  our  products  and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.

People access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, phones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables (including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and televisionstreaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices.

<!-- page break -->

It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities.

## Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure.

Our  evolving  AI-related  efforts  may  give  rise  to  risks  related  to  harmful  content,  inaccuracies,  discrimination,  intellectual  property infringement or misappropriation, violation of rights of publicity, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action,  legal  liability  (including  under  new  and  proposed  legislation  and  regulations),  new  applications  of  existing  data  protection,  privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm.

Some uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI responsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant resources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services,  but  we  may  not  be  able  to  identify  or  resolve  all AI-related  issues,  deficiencies,  and/or  failures  before  they  arise.  Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our AI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may result in claims, lawsuits,  brand  or  reputational  harm,  and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny,  any  of  which  could  harm  our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation, cause us to incur significant  liability,  and  deter  current  and  potential  users  or  customers  from  using  our  products  and  services.  Computer  viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users' and customers' ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation.

Concerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, disclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change.

Our products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information. Malicious software such as viruses, software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, as well as cyber attacks, phishing schemes, and other  types  of  security  breaches  expose  us  to  a  risk  of  loss  or  improper  use  and  disclosure  of  such  information,  which  could  result  in litigation  and  other  potential  liabilities,  including  regulatory  fines  and  penalties,  as  well  as  reputational  harm.  Additionally,  our  products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features involving AI to our offerings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our and the market's understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to develop. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only  after  we  have  released  the  code.  Systems  and  control  failures,  security  breaches,  failure  to  comply  with  our  privacy  policies,  and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in regulatory and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches.

We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. Cyber attacks continue to evolve  in  sophistication  and  volume,  and  inherently  may  be  difficult  to  detect  for  long  periods  of  time.  For  example,  the  development  and implementation of AI technologies may further increase our exposure to or exacerbate the risks of cyber attacks or other security incidents, particularly where such technologies are exploited by third parties to breach our or other parties' systems, including when such technologies are used to target our employees or impersonate members of senior management in order to gain unauthorized access to our systems. We have also seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect our or other parties' systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to prevent security incidents and address undesirable activity on our platform may require us to spend additional resources to prepare and defend against such threats, and could also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition,

<!-- page break -->

we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks.

We  may  experience  security  and/or  privacy  issues,  whether  due  to  employee  or  insider  error  or  malfeasance,  system  errors,  or vulnerabilities in our or other parties' systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the time they occur and may remedy  them  quickly,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  these  issues  will  not  ultimately  result  in  significant  legal,  financial,  and  reputational  harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may  not  be  determined  to  be  material  at  a  later  date  in  the  aggregate,  even  if  they  may  not  be  material  individually  at  the  time  of  their occurrence.  Because  the  techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access  to,  disable  or  degrade  service  provided  by  or  otherwise  sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including those  required  by  law,  we  have  been  unable  in  the  past  and  may  continue  to  be  unable  to  anticipate  or  detect  attacks  or  vulnerabilities  or implement adequate preventative measures.

Further, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-security practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners' or service providers' security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness  of  our  security  measures  would  be  harmed,  we  could  lose  users  and  customers,  our  trade  secrets  or  those  of  our  business partners may be compromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include classaction litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

While we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

For additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under 'Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies' below.

## Our ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data.

In addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and review efforts to  combat  misuse  of  our  services  and  unauthorized  access  to  user  data  by  third  parties,  including  investigation  and  review  of  platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered, and may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including our lack of visibility  over  our  encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election  interference,  improper  ad  purchases,  activities  that  threaten  people's  safety  on-  or  off-line,  or  instances  of  spamming,  scraping,  or spreading disinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  these  issues  will  not  ultimately  result  in  significant  legal,  financial,  and  reputational  harm,  including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence.

We may also  be  unsuccessful  in  our  efforts  to  enforce  our  policies  or  otherwise  prevent  or  remediate  any  such  incidents. Any  of  the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.

<!-- page break -->

## Problematic  content  on  our  platforms,  including  low-quality  user-generated  content,  web  spam,  content  farms,  and  other violations  of  our  guidelines  could  affect  the  quality  of  our  services,  which  could  harm  our  reputation  and  deter  our  current  and potential users from using our products and services.

We, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent lowquality  content  and  invalid  traffic,  we  have  been  unable  and  may  continue  to  be  unable  to  detect  and  prevent  all  such  abuses  or  promote uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of abuse for bad actors.

Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, or undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms, there  is  no  guarantee  that  our  technology  will  always  be  successful,  and  our  users  may  have  negative  experiences  on  our  platforms  if  our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users' decisions in continuing to use our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from lowquality  websites,  but  we  may  not  always  be  successful.  We  also  face  other  challenges  on  our  platforms,  including  violations  of  our  content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference; activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.

If  we  fail  to  either  detect  and  prevent  an  increase  in  problematic  content  or  effectively  promote  high-quality  content,  it  could  hurt  our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject  us  to  litigation  and  regulatory  actions,  which  could  result  in  monetary  penalties  and  damages  and  divert  management's  time  and attention.

## Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.

Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network capacity to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and  elsewhere  regarding  such  protections.  In  addition,  in  some  jurisdictions,  our  products  and  services  have  been  subject  to  governmentinitiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting our business.

## Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies

## We are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.

We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our introduction  of  new  businesses,  products,  services,  and  technologies  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations.

<!-- page break -->

New or changing laws and regulations, or interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations  of  such  laws  and  regulations  and/or  our  practices,  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  less  useful  products  and services,  altered  business  models  and  operations,  limited  ability  to  pursue  certain  business  practices  or  offer  certain  products  and  services, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding:

- Competition and technology platforms' business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal settlements in the U.S., South Korea, and elsewhere that affect  Google  Play's  billing  policies,  fees,  and  business  model;  as  well  as  litigation  and  new  and  expected  regulations  in  a  range  of jurisdictions, including, among others, in the UK, Japan, and India.
- AI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital products and services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, the EU AI Act came into force on August 1, 2024, and will generally become fully applicable after a two-year transitional period (although certain obligations will take effect at an earlier or later time). The EU AI Act introduces various requirements for AI systems and models placed on the market or put into service in the EU, including specific transparency and other requirements for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are based.  In  the  U.S.,  there  is  increasing  uncertainty  as  to  the  federal  government's  approach  to  AI  regulation  going  forward,  as  the continued  applicability  of  the  White  House's  2023  Executive  Order  on  the  Safe,  Secure,  and  Trustworthy  Development  and  Use  of Artificial Intelligence, which lays out a framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to monitor private sector development of certain foundation models, remains subject to regulatory development. Several states are considering enacting or have already enacted regulations concerning the use of AI technologies, including those focused on consumer protection, and depending on the scope of AI regulation at the federal level, some states may move to regulate AI model development and deployment. Further, at the federal and state  level,  there  have  been  various  proposals  (and  in  some  cases  laws  enacted)  addressing  'deepfakes'  and  other  AI-generated synthetic media.
- Data  privacy,  collection,  processing,  and  portability: Laws  and  regulations  further  restricting  the  collection,  processing,  and/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the processing of children's data (as  discussed  further  below),  data  breach  notification  laws;  laws  limiting  data  transfers  (including  data  localization  laws);  and  laws requiring data portability (including the EU Data Act, as discussed further below).
- Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which have introduced new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers, which may result in other regulatory actions.
- Content moderation: Various  laws  covering  content  moderation  and  removal,  and  related  disclosure  obligations,  such  as  the  EU's Digital Services Act, Florida's Senate Bill 7072 and Texas' House Bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with low-quality,  deceptive,  or  harmful  content,  or  on  the  other  hand,  may  impinge  on  the  rights  of  free  expression,  which,  in  turn,  could impact  how  our  platforms  are  viewed  by  users.  Additionally,  legislators  are  increasingly  focused  on  regulating  online  child  safety, including content protections for minors under eighteen years of age. These regulations could result in our having to modify our products and services and incur additional costs to operate and monitor minors' experiences on our products and services.
- Consumer protection: Consumer  protection  laws,  including  the  EU's  New  Deal  for  Consumers,  which  could  result  in  monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.

In  addition,  the  applicability  and  scope  of  these  and  other  laws  and  regulations,  as  interpreted  by  courts,  regulators,  or  administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the Digital Services Act in Europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may harm us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms. Our development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including our

<!-- page break -->

implementation  of AI  in  our  offerings  and  internal  systems)  could  subject  us  to  regulatory  action  and  legal  liability,  including  under  specific legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws.

Further, we are subject to evolving laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to matters beyond our core products and services, including environmental sustainability, climate change, human capital, and employment matters. In response, we have implemented robust programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced a number of complex and ambitious goals and initiatives that may require considerable investments. We cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate.

## We are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability, including competition matters, that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We  are  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  regulatory  and  government  inquiries  and  investigations,  other  proceedings,  and  orders  involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file in the future, several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store.

For example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google violated antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. The  Court  is  holding  a  separate  proceeding  to  determine  remedies,  which  could  include  alterations  to  our  products  and  services  and  our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal, there can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of any remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Also, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated antitrust laws relating to Google Play's business. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024 that ordered a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the verdict, but if we are unsuccessful, we could  face  significant  expenses  to  implement  the  remedies,  and  such  costs  and  alterations  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial condition, and operating results.

Furthermore, in December 2020, several State Attorneys General, led by the Texas Attorney General, filed an antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated antitrust and other laws relating to its advertising technology. This case is set for trial in March 2025, and we could face significant civil penalties. In January 2023, the DOJ and several Attorneys General sued in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging similar antitrust violations relating to Google's advertising technology. Trial in the DOJ matter concluded in September 2024 with a decision expected in early 2025. If  we  are  unsuccessful,  we  could  face  an  order  on  remedies  that  could  harm  our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

In  addition  to  these  regulatory  proceedings,  private  individual  and  collective  actions  that  overlap  with  claims  pursued  by  regulators  are pending  in  the  U.S.  and  in  several  other  jurisdictions.  Adverse  results  in  these  or  similar  future  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  monetary damages and remedies that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Other  regulatory  agencies  in  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world,  including  competition  enforcers,  consumer  protection  agencies,  and  data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.

We are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects,  among  other  litigation,  and  we  may  also  be  subject  to  claims  involving  health  and  safety,  hazardous  materials  usage,  other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for

<!-- page break -->

defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and effect  of  our  products  and  services,  or  due  to  our  involvement  in  hosting,  transmitting,  marketing,  branding,  or  providing  access  to  content created by third parties.

Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past, and may in the future result  in  substantial  fines  and  penalties,  injunctive  relief,  ongoing  monitoring  and  auditing  obligations,  changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including divestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences. Any of these legal proceedings could also result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, and negative publicity, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and speculative process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or exceed our estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in,  and  may  in  the  future  result  in,  additional  substantial  fines,  penalties,  injunctions,  and  other  sanctions  that  could  harm  our  business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

For additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Privacy, data protection, data usage, and portability regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Authorities  around  the  world  have  adopted  and  are  considering  a  number  of  legislative  and  regulatory  proposals  concerning  data protection, data usage and portability, and encryption of user data. Additionally, the increasing adoption of AI technologies, which rely on the collection of large amounts of data and use of such data for training purposes, has led data protection authorities around the world to consider and adopt new and evolving interpretations of data protection laws, imposing specific obligations with respect to the processing of personal data, including required notices, consents, and opt-outs. Further, the increased risk of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or personal data in connection with the utilization of AI technologies may result in stronger regulatory scrutiny, leading to legal and regulatory investigations and  enforcement  actions  that  may  negatively  affect  our  business,  even  if  unfounded.  Adverse  legal  rulings,  legislation,  or  regulation  have resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include:

- The EU General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or related to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.
- Various  U.S.  federal,  U.S.  state,  and  foreign  privacy  laws  related  to  the  processing  and  security  of  personal  data,  including  (1) comprehensive privacy laws that  provide  data  privacy  rights  (including,  in  California,  a  private  right  of  action  in  the  event  of  a  data breach  resulting  from  our  failure  to  implement  and  maintain  reasonable  security  procedures  and  practices)  and  impose  significant obligations  on  controllers  and  processors  of  consumer  data;  (2)  laws  imposing  obligations  on  businesses  that  collect  or  disclose biometric information (including, in Illinois, Texas, and Washington); (3) laws governing the collection and processing of children and minor's  data  and  how  companies  provide  age  appropriate  online  experiences  (including,  in  the  U.S.,  the  Children's  Online  Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the pending Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0), which passed the U.S. Senate in 2024,  and  similar  U.S.  state  laws  related  to  children's  privacy,  such  as  the  New  York  Child  Data  Protection  Act,  and  the  United Kingdom's Age-Appropriate Design Code); and (4) laws regulating internet-connected devices (such as, in California, the Internet of Things Security Law).
- The EU's Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data across certain products and  require  search  engines  to  share  anonymized  data  with  rival  companies,  among  other  changes;  and  the  EU  Data  Act,  which introduces new data portability requirements with respect to connected products (i.e., 'internet of things' products) and related services, as well as interoperability obligations on data processing services.

<!-- page break -->

Further, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive personal data, as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we currently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments globally, which may require us to adapt our existing arrangements.

## We face, and may continue to face, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of rights of publicity, and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies.

We, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-anddesist orders. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies, including AI technologies.

Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or elsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain jurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.

Many of  our  agreements  with  our  customers  and  partners,  including  certain  suppliers,  require  us  to  defend  against  certain  intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover  all  damages  and  losses  suffered  by  us  and  our  customers  arising  from  intellectual  property  infringement  claims.  Furthermore,  in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those  associated  with  intellectual  property  claims.  Regardless  of  their  merits,  intellectual  property  claims  are  often  time  consuming  and expensive  to  litigate  or  settle.  To  the  extent  such  claims  are  successful,  they  could  harm  our  business,  including  our  product  and  service offerings, financial condition, and operating results.

## We could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities.

We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges  and  related  transactions  under  our  foreign  exchange  risk  management  program,  changes  in  our  stock  price  for  shares  issued  as employee compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties.

We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in the future  receive,  assessments  in  multiple  jurisdictions,  on  various  tax-related  assertions,  such  as  transfer-pricing  adjustments  or  permanentestablishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.

Furthermore,  due  to  shifting  economic  and  political  conditions,  tax  policies,  laws,  or  rates  in  various  jurisdictions  may  be  subject  to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For example, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax

<!-- page break -->

regimes. The U.S. has imposed a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of shares repurchased, which could potentially increase in the future. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%, on which various jurisdictions around the world have either introduced draft legislation or adopted final legislation. Our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase as a result of these changes.

## Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock

## We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or dividends could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.

We engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. In April 2024, we announced the approval of our cash dividend program and began paying regular cash dividends to our Class A, Class B, and Class C stockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our Board of Directors may decide not to declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of Directors to declare a dividend at any specific dollar amount per share. Any such decision  by  our  Board  of  Directors  may  depend  on  a  variety  of  factors  that  it  may  deem  relevant,  including  but  not  limited  to  our  earnings, liquidity, financial condition, other capital deployment opportunities, level of indebtedness, and general market conditions. Our share repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.

## The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.

Our Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2024, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 87.4% of our outstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 52.1% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey's current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey's relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.

## Provisions  in  our  charter  documents  and  under  Delaware  law  could  discourage  a  takeover  that  stockholders  may  consider favorable.

Provisions  in  Alphabet's  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws  may  have  the  effect  of  delaying  or  preventing  a  change  of  control  or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:

- Our  Board  of  Directors  has  the  right  to  elect  directors  to  fill  a  vacancy  created  by  the  expansion  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  the resignation, death, or removal of a director.
- Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.
- Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.
- Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.

<!-- page break -->

- Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.

As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.

## The trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile.

The trading  price  of  our  stock  has  at  times  experienced  significant  volatility  and  may  continue  to  be  volatile.  In  addition  to  the  factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or continuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.

## General Risks

## Our  operating  results  may  fluctuate,  which  makes  our  results  difficult  to  predict  and  could  cause  our  results  to  fall  short  of expectations.

Our operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, comparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Consequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.

## Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these  transactions  could  be  material  to  our  financial  condition  and  operating  results.  We  expect  to  continue  to  evaluate  and  enter  into discussions  regarding  a  wide  array  of  such  potential  strategic  arrangements,  which  could  create  unforeseen  operating  difficulties  and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:

- diversion  of  management  time  and  focus  from  operating  our  business  to  challenges  related  to  acquisitions  and  other  strategic arrangements;
- failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities; conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction; or investigations or litigation by governmental authorities related to our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements;
- failure  to  successfully  integrate  the  acquired  operations,  technologies,  services,  and  personnel  (including  cultural  integration  and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;
- implementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired company;
- integration of the acquired company's accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;
- transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;
- in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;
- failure  to  accomplish  commercial,  strategic  or  financial  objectives  with  respect  to  investments,  joint  ventures,  and  other  strategic arrangements;
- failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;
- liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data privacy and  security  issues,  violations  of  laws,  commercial  disputes,  tax  liabilities,  warranty  claims,  product  liabilities,  and  other  known  and unknown liabilities; and

<!-- page break -->

- litigation  or  other  claims  in  connection  with  the  acquired  company,  including  claims  from  terminated  employees,  customers,  former stockholders, or other third parties.

Our failure  to  address  these  risks  or  other  problems  encountered  in  connection  with  our  past  or  future  acquisitions  and  other  strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.

Our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize. In connection with our divestitures and certain other strategic arrangements, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.

## We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or operate effectively.

Our performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as well as members of our senior  management  team.  For  instance,  Sundar  Pichai  is  critical  to  the  overall  management  of Alphabet  and  its  subsidiaries  and  plays  an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting our strategic direction.

Our ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have  directly  targeted,  and  may  continue  to  target,  our  employees.  In  addition,  our  compensation  arrangements,  such  as  our  equity  award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies.

In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows and evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture. Under our hybrid work  models,  we  may  experience  increased  costs  and/or  disruption,  in  addition  to  potential  effects  on  our  ability  to  operate  effectively  and maintain our corporate culture.

## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Not applicable.

## ITEM 1C.     CYBERSECURITY

We maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats as part of our broader  risk  management  system  and  processes.  For  example,  some  risks  include  our  software  supply  chain  and  other  third-party dependencies, vulnerabilities in our products and services, theft of our intellectual property, and attempts to compromise our infrastructure. We obtain input, as appropriate, for our cybersecurity risk management program on the security industry and threat trends from multiple external experts  and  internal  threat  intelligence  teams.  Teams  of  dedicated  privacy,  safety,  and  security  professionals  oversee  cybersecurity  risk management  and  mitigation,  incident  prevention,  detection,  and  remediation.  These  teams  comprise  professionals  with  deep  cybersecurity expertise  across  multiple  industries  and  are  led  by  our  Vice  President  of  Privacy,  Safety,  and  Security  Engineering,  who  has  20  years  of experience, including roles in technology infrastructure for two other large public companies. Our executive leadership team, along with input from the above teams, are responsible for our overall enterprise risk management system and processes and regularly consider cybersecurity risks in the context of other material risks to the company.

As part of our cybersecurity risk management system, our incident management teams track and log privacy and security incidents across Alphabet, our vendors, and other third-party service providers to remediate and resolve any such incidents. Significant incidents are reviewed regularly by a cross-functional working group to determine whether further escalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or  potentially  becoming  material  is  promptly  escalated  for  further  assessment,  and  then  reported  to  designated  members  of  our  senior management. We consult with outside counsel as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our senior

<!-- page break -->

management makes the final materiality determinations and disclosure and other compliance decisions. Our management apprises Alphabet's independent public accounting firm of matters and any relevant developments.

The  Audit  and  Compliance  Committee  has  oversight  responsibility  for  risks  and  incidents  relating  to  cybersecurity  threats,  including compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation with law enforcement, and related effects on financial and other risks, and it reports any findings  and  recommendations,  as  appropriate,  to  the  full  Board  for  consideration.

## PART II

## ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

As of October 2, 2015, Alphabet Inc. became the successor issuer of Google Inc. pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act. Our Class A stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol 'GOOG' since August 19, 2004, and under the symbol "GOOGL" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no public market for our stock. Our Class B stock is neither listed nor traded. Our Class C stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol 'GOOG' since April 3, 2014.

## Holders of Record

As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 7,743 and 1,671 stockholders of record of our Class A stock and Class C stock, respectively.  Because  many  of  our  shares  of  Class  A  stock  and  Class  C  stock  are  held  by  brokers  and  other  institutions  on  behalf  of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 57 stockholders of record of our Class B stock.

## Dividend Program

Dividend payments to stockholders of Class A, Class B, and Class C shares were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.

## ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with 'Note about ForwardLooking Statements,' Part  I,  Item  1  "Business,"  Part  I,  Item  1A  "Risk  Factors,"  and  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following section generally discusses 2024 results compared to 2023 results. Discussion of 2023 results compared to 2022 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results

Alphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect

The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:

- Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.

The continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. We expect that this  evolution  will  continue  to  benefit  our  business  and  our  revenues,  although  at  a  slower  pace  than  we  have  experienced  historically.  In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and services, which may affect our revenues.

## · Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.

Our users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities beyond traditional desktop, such as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.

We benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular  device  type  or  modality  matures,  our  advertising  revenues  may  be  affected.  For  example,  changing  dynamics  within  the  global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.

We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues ("TAC rate") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage  of  queries  channeled  through  paid  access  points;  product  mix;  the  relative  revenue  growth  rates  of  advertising  revenues  from different channels; and revenue share terms.

We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.

## · As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization.

As interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our products and services. We expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization.

## · As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.

The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased

<!-- page break -->

revenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.

International revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.

## · The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.

Revenues  from  cloud,  consumer  subscriptions,  platforms,  and  devices,  which  may  have  differing  characteristics  than  our  advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services. The margins on these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  are  generally  lower  than  the  margins  on  our  advertising  revenues.  For  example,  sales  of  our  devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.

## · As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.

We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2024,  our  investment  in  our  technical  infrastructure,  including  servers,  network  equipment,  and  data  centers,  to  support  the  growth  of  our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments remain important elements in our use of capital and contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives.

## · We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and financial results.

Changes in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our products and services may become less useful, our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business models and operations to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## · Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.

Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information, see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Revenues and Monetization Metrics

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all  sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscriptionbased products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:

- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
- changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;
- general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;
- new product, service, and market launches; and

<!-- page break -->

- seasonality.

Additionally,  fluctuations  in  our  revenues  generated  from  advertising  ("Google  advertising"),  other  sources  ("Google  subscriptions, platforms, and devices"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.

## Google Services

Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues.

## Google Advertising

Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following:

- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their  default  search  in  browsers,  toolbars,  etc.),  and  other  Google  owned  and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and
- Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to  traffic  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties,  while  impressions  and  cost-per-impression  pertain  to  traffic  on  our Google Network properties.

Paid clicks  represent  engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google  owned  and  operated  properties  including  Gmail,  Google  Maps,  and  Google  Play.  Cost-per-click  is  defined  as  click-driven  revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.

Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.

Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &amp; other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as:

- advertiser competition for keywords;
- changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;
- changes in device mix;
- seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and
- traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.

## Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices

Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:

- consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;
- platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;
- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and
- other products and services.

<!-- page break -->

Fluctuations  in  our  Google  subscriptions,  platforms,  and  devices  revenues  have  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  affected  by  factors  in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and the timing of product launches.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:

- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;
- Google  Workspace,  which  includes  subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and
- other enterprise services.

Fluctuations  in  our  Google  Cloud  revenues  have  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  affected  by  factors  in  addition  to  the  general  factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.

## Other Bets

Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services, and internet services.

## Costs and Expenses

Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years.

## Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.

- TAC includes:
- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and
- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
- Other cost of revenues primarily includes:
- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  providers  from  whom  we  license  video  and  other  content  for distribution,  primarily  related  to  YouTube  (we  pay  fees  to  these  content  providers  based  on  revenues  generated,  subscriber counts, or a flat fee);
- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;
- employee  compensation  expenses  related  to  our  technical  infrastructure  and  other  operations  such  as  content  review  and customer and product support;
- inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and
- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.

TAC  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  generated  from  ads  placed  on  Google  Network  properties  are  significantly  higher  than  TAC  as  a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.

## Operating Expenses

<!-- page break -->

Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.

The main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:

- depreciation;
- employee  compensation  expenses  for  engineering  and  technical  employees  responsible  for  R&amp;D  related  to  our  existing  and  new products and services; and
- third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts.

The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:

- employee  compensation  expenses  for  employees  engaged  in  sales  and  marketing,  sales  support,  and  certain  customer  service functions; and
- spend relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.

The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:

- employee compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions;
- expenses relating to legal and other matters, including certain fines and settlements; and
- third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

OI&amp;E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.

For  additional  information,  including  how  we  account  for  our  investments  and  factors  that  can  drive  fluctuations  in  the  value  of  our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 as well as Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  The  provision  includes  the  effect  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are  considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

For additional information, including a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

- Revenues were $350.0 billion, an increase of 14% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services revenues of $32.4 billion, or 12%, and an increase in Google Cloud revenues of $10.1 billion, or 31%.
- Total constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 15% year over year.
- Cost of revenues was $146.3 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, primarily driven by increases in content acquisition costs, TAC, and depreciation expense.
- Operating  expenses  were  $91.3  billion,  an  increase  of  2%  year  over  year,  primarily  driven  by  increases  in  depreciation  expense, employee compensation expenses, and third-party services fees. These increases were partially offset by reductions in charges related to legal and other matters and charges related to our office space optimization efforts. The overall increase in employee compensation expenses was partially offset by a reduction in employee severance and related charges.

## Google Services

## Google advertising revenues

## Google Search &amp; other

Google Search &amp; other revenues increased $23.1 billion from 2023 to 2024. The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases  in  search  queries  resulting  from  growth  in  user  adoption  and  usage  on  mobile  devices;  growth  in  advertiser  spending;  and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.

## YouTube ads

YouTube ads revenues increased $4.6 billion from 2023 to 2024. The growth was driven by our brand advertising products followed by our direct response advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers.

## Google Network

Google Network revenues decreased $953 million from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by a decrease in Google Ad Manager and AdMob revenues. Additionally, Google Network revenues were adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

## Monetization Metrics

The following  table  presents  changes  in  monetization  metrics  for  Google  Search  &amp;  other  revenues  (paid  clicks  and  cost-per-click)  and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a percentage, from 2023 to 2024:

| Google Search & other      |       |
|----------------------------|-------|
| Paid clicks change         | 5%    |
| Cost-per-click change      | 7%    |
| Google Network             |       |
| Impressions change         | (11)% |
| Cost-per-impression change | 10%   |

Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.

Changes  in  cost-per-click  and  cost-per-impression  are  driven  by  a  number  of  interrelated  factors  including  changes  in  device  mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

## Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices

Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $5.7 billion from 2023 to 2024. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscription revenues, largely from growth in the number of paid subscribers for YouTube services followed by Google One.

## Google Cloud

Google  Cloud  revenues  increased  $10.1  billion  from  2023  to  2024  primarily  driven  by  growth  in  Google  Cloud  Platform  largely  from infrastructure services.

## Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information

International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use nonGAAP  constant  currency  revenues  ("constant  currency  revenues")  and  non-GAAP  percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.

Constant  currency  information  compares  results  between  periods  as  if  exchange  rates  had  remained  constant  period  over  period.  We define  constant  currency  revenues  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements  ("FX  Effect")  as  well  as hedging  activities,  which  are  recognized  at  the  consolidated  level.  We  use  constant  currency  revenues  to  determine  the  constant  currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.

Constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  is  calculated  by  determining  the  change  in  current  period  revenues  over  prior  year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.

These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Total constant currency revenues of $352.7 billion for 2024 increased $45.6 billion compared to $307.2 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for 2023. (1)

EMEA  revenue  growth  was  not  materially  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  as  the  effect  of  the  U.S.  dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira was offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the British pound and the euro.

APAC  revenue  growth  was  unfavorably  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  primarily  due  to  the  U.S.  dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.

Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real.

| Total cost of revenues                             | $ 133,332                 | $ 146,306                 |
| Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues | 43%                       | 42%                       |

Cost of revenues increased $13.0 billion from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $9.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively.

The increase in TAC from 2023 to 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.4% to 20.7% from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network  properties  to  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties.  The  TAC  rate  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other  revenues  increased  from  2023  to  2024 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues was substantially consistent from 2023 to 2024.

The increase in other cost of revenues from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, depreciation expense, and other technical infrastructure operations costs.

## Research and Development

| Research and development expenses                             | $ 45,427                  | $ 49,326                  |
| Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues | 15%                       | 14%                       |

R&amp;D expenses increased $3.9 billion from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by increases in employee compensation expenses of $1.5 billion, depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, and third-party services fees of $698 million, partially offset by a reduction in charges related to our office space optimization efforts of $640 million. The increase in employee compensation expenses was primarily driven by a $1.3 billion increase in SBC expenses, which includes the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by a $537 million decrease in severance and related charges.

## Sales and Marketing

The following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages):

|                                                          | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                                                          | 2023                      | 2024                      |
| Sales and marketing expenses                             | $ 27,917                  | 27,808                    |
| Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues | 9%                        | 8%                        |

Sales and marketing expenses decreased $109 million from 2023 to 2024, due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.

## General and Administrative

The following table presents general and administrative expenses (in millions, except percentages):

|                                                                 | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                                                                 | 2023                      | 2024                      |
| General and administrative expenses                             | 16,425                    | $ 14,188                  |
| General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues | 5%                        | 4%                        |

General and administrative expenses decreased $2.2 billion from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by a reduction in charges related to legal and other matters of $1.3 billion and a decrease in employee compensation expenses of $285 million, primarily due to a decrease in average headcount, in addition to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.

## Segment Profitability

We report  our  segment  results  as  Google  Services,  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets. Additionally,  certain  costs  are  not  allocated  to  our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following table presents segment operating income (loss) (in millions).

## Google Services

Google Services operating income increased $25.4 billion from 2023 to 2024. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset  by  increases  in  content  acquisition  costs  and TAC. Additionally,  a  reduction  in  employee  compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud operating income increased $4.4 billion from 2023 to 2024. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase  in  revenues,  partially  offset  by  increases  in  usage  costs  for  technical  infrastructure  as  well  as  employee  compensation  expenses, largely driven by headcount growth.

## Other Bets

Other Bets operating loss increased $349 million from 2023 to 2024. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in expenses, largely driven by employee compensation expenses in addition to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. The increase in employee compensation expenses was primarily as a result of the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period.

OI&amp;E, net increased $6.0 billion from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to an increase in net gains on equity securities and a decrease in net losses on foreign currency exchange. The net gains on equity securities were primarily due to net unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities  driven  by  fair  value  adjustments  related  to  observable  transactions,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  net  unrealized  gains  on marketable  equity  securities  due  to  market-driven  changes.  Foreign  currency  exchange  net  losses  decreased  compared  to  the  prior  year primarily due to prior year losses in unhedged currencies.

In  January  2025,  we  recognized  an  $8.0  billion  unrealized  gain  on  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  related  to  our  investment  in  a private company. The unrealized gain reflects an increase in the fair value measurement of our investment following an observable transaction in January 2025.

## Provision for Income Taxes

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):

|                                          | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                                          | 2023                      | 2024                      |
| Income before provision for income taxes | $ 85,717                  | $ 119,815                 |
| Provision for income taxes               | $ 11,922                  | $ 19,697                  |
| Effective tax rate                       | 13.9%                     | 16.4%                     |

The effective tax rate increased from 2023 to 2024. This increase was primarily due to a one-time adjustment for tax rule changes issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that affected the 2023 rate related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits, as well as a separate rule change with guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&amp;D

expenses. Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation-related tax benefits in 2024.

The OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to  international  tax  policies,  including  the  implementation  of  a  minimum  global  effective  tax  rate  of  15%.  Some  countries  have  already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect others to follow, however this did not have a material effect on our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year.

## Financial Condition

## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities

As of December 31, 2024, we had $95.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgagebacked and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities.

## Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.

The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):

|                                           | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                                           | 2023                      | 2024                      |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 101,746                 | $ 125,299                 |
| Net cash used in investing activities     | $ (27,063)                | $ (45,536)                |
| Net cash used in financing activities     | $ (72,093)                | $ (79,733)                |

## Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Our  largest  source  of  cash  provided  by  operations  are  advertising  revenues  generated  by  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties,  Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app  purchases,  and  devices.  In  Google  Cloud,  we  generate  cash  through  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud services.

Our  primary  uses  of  cash  from  operating  activities  include  payments  to  distribution  and  Google  Network  partners,  to  employees  for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses.

## Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash  used  in  investing  activities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  purchases  of  property  and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities. The increase in purchases of property and equipment is primarily driven by investments in technical infrastructure.

## Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  consists  primarily  of  proceeds  from  issuance  of  debt  and  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  interests  in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to dividend payments and net payments related to stock-based award activities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments.

<!-- page break -->

## Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities  and  cash  commitments  for  investing  and  financing  activities  for  at  least  the  next  12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

## Capital Expenditures and Leases

We make investments in land, buildings, and servers and network equipment through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.

## Capital Expenditures

Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:

- technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, and data center land and building construction; and
- office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").

Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including assets in the process of construction or assembly, and consists primarily of technical infrastructure. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install servers and network equipment.

During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, we spent $32.3 billion and $52.5 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and  equipment  commences  when  the  deployment  of  such  assets  are  completed  and  are  ready  for  our  intended  use.  For  the  years  ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment was $11.9 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively.

## Leases

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, we recognized additional operating lease assets of $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, and additional  finance  lease  assets  of  $564  million  and  $313  million,  respectively.  As  of  December  31,  2024,  the  amount  of  total  future  lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.8 years, was $17.0 billion, of which $3.2 billion is short-term, and total future lease payments under finance leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years, was $1.9 billion, of which $257 million is short-term. As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term lease payments of $773 million and $6.5 billion, respectively, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2028 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years.

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $4.5 billion and $4.7  billion,  respectively.  Finance  lease  costs  were  $504  million  and  $444  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2023  and  2024, respectively. For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Financing

We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.3 billion of short-term commercial paper outstanding.

As of December 31, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion with short-term and longterm future interest payments of $197 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities. For additional information, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

<!-- page break -->

We primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Share Repurchase Program

During 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 379 million shares for $62.0 billion.

In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

## Dividend Program

During the year ended December 31, 2024 total cash dividends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.

The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

## European Commission Fines

In 2017, 2018, and 2019, the European Commission (EC) announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively.

In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending.

In September 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal of the 2017 decision and upheld the €2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.

In  September 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.

We included the outstanding EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Taxes

As of December 31, 2024, we had income taxes payable of $2.7 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is due in 2025. We also had long-term taxes payable of $8.8 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024.

## Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $55.4 billion, of which $32.5 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the  minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements

<!-- page break -->

with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable  energy  certificates.  These  agreements  do  not  include  a  minimum  dollar  commitment.  The  amounts  to  be  paid  under  these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.

For  a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  and  the  effect  on  our  financial  statements,  see  Note  1  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Fair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities

We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-marketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method ("the measurement alternative") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.

Non-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs,  including  discount  rates,  investee  revenues  and  costs,  and  comparable  market  data  of  private  and  public  companies,  among  others. When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.

We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. performance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs.

## Property and Equipment

We assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the asset.

## Income Taxes

We  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  evaluating  our  uncertain  tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.

Recording  an  uncertain  tax  position  involves  various  qualitative  considerations,  including  evaluation  of  comparable  and  resolved  tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such

<!-- page break -->

differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.

The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

## Loss Contingencies

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We evaluate,  on  a  regular  basis,  developments  in  our  legal  matters  that  could  affect  the  amount  of  liability  that  has  been  previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.

## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks.

## Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We  transact  business  globally  in  multiple  currencies.  International  revenues,  as  well  as  costs  and  expenses  denominated  in  foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative  instruments  to  hedge  foreign  currency  risk.  Principal  currencies  hedged  included  the  Australian  dollar,  British  pound,  Canadian dollar,  Euro,  and  Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced.

We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&amp;E, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.

If an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to net monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $503 million and $135 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024.

We use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar  weakens,  losses  from  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  offset  the  foreign  currency  gains  related  to  our  earnings.  These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as  cash  flow  hedges  for  accounting  purposes.  We  reflect  the  gains  and  losses  of  foreign  currency  spot  rate  changes  as  a  component  of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.

If  the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion lower as of

<!-- page break -->

December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.

We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations.

If  the  U.S.  dollar  weakened  by  10%,  the  amount  recorded  in  cumulative  translation  adjustment  (CTA)  within  AOCI  related  to  our  net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $946 million and $660 million lower as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.

## Interest Rate Risk

Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. We invest primarily  in  debt  securities,  including  government  bonds,  corporate  debt  securities,  mortgage-backed  and  asset-backed  securities,  money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair  market  value  adversely  affected  due  to  a  rise  in  interest  rates,  while  floating  rate  securities  may  produce  less  income  than  predicted  if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&amp;E. We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.

We use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our investment portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates.  We  use  a  variance/covariance  VaR  model  with  95%  confidence  interval.  The  estimated  one-day  loss  in  fair  value  of  our  investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 are shown below (in millions):

|                               | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | 12-Month Average As of December 31,   | 12-Month Average As of December 31,   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|                               | 2023                 | 2024                 | 2023                                  | 2024                                  |
| Risk category - interest rate | $ 296                | $ 208                | $ 271                                 | $ 230                                 |

Actual future gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.

## Equity Investment Risk

Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.

Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.

We record marketable equity securities  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  at  fair  value  based  on  readily  determinable  market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and represent $6.0 billion and $5.1 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. A hypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $508 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.

Our  non-marketable  equity  securities  not  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  are  primarily  adjusted  to  fair  value  for  observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky  because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and

<!-- page break -->

observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation  of  non-marketable  equity  securities  may  not  directly  correlate  with  changes  in  valuation  of  marketable  equity  securities.  As  of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $28.8 billion and $35.5 billion, respectively.

The carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.

For additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet  Inc.  (the  Company)  as  of  December  31,  2023  and  2024,  the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2024,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework),  and  our  report  dated February 4, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud.  Our  audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

## Loss Contingencies

## Description of the Matter

## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

## /s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP

We have served as the Company's auditor since 1999.

San Jose, California February 4, 2025

The Company is subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,  commercial  disputes,  content  generated  by  its  users,  goods  and  services  offered  by  advertisers  or publishers using their platforms, personal injury, and other matters. As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements  'Commitments  and  Contingencies'  such  claims,  lawsuits, regulatory  and  government  inquiries  and investigations, other proceedings, and orders could result in adverse consequences.

Significant  judgment  is  required  to  determine  both  the  likelihood  and  the  estimated  amount  of  a  loss  related  to  such matters.  Auditing  management's  accounting  for  and  disclosure  of  loss  contingencies  from  these  matters  involved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in assessing the Company's evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or range of loss.

We tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management's accounting for and disclosure of these matters. This included controls over management's assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable and the development of related disclosures.

Our audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings and the status of ongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters from internal and external legal counsel addressing the matters, meeting with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter from management on these matters. We also evaluated the Company's disclosures in relation to these matters.

## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.

## Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Alphabet Inc.'s internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2024,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework)  (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 4, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

The  Company's  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Nature of Operations

Google  was  incorporated  in  California  in  September  1998  and  re-incorporated  in  the  State  of  Delaware  in August  2003.  In  2015,  we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all  sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscriptionbased products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.

## Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

## Use of Estimates

Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts  reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these estimates  due  to  uncertainties.  On  an  ongoing  basis,  we  evaluate  our  estimates,  including  those  related  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses; contingent  liabilities;  fair  values  of  financial  instruments  and  goodwill;  income  taxes;  inventory;  and  useful  lives  of  property  and  equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

## Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized  when  control  of  the  promised  goods  or  services  is  transferred  to  our  customers,  and  the  collectibility  of  an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.

## Advertising Revenues

We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:

- Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
- YouTube properties; and
- Google  Network  properties,  including  revenues  from  Google  Network  properties  participating  in  AdMob,  AdSense,  and  Google  Ad Manager.

Our  customers  generally  purchase  advertising  inventory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and Google Marketing Platform, among others.

We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.

For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability  to  monetize  the  advertising  inventory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers  and  is  further  supported  by  us  being  primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.

## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices

Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:

<!-- page break -->

- consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;
- platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;
- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and
- other products and services.

Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee.

## Google Cloud Revenues

Google Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:

- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;
- Google  Workspace,  which  includes  subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and
- other enterprise services.

Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.

## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations

Our  contracts  with  customers  may  include  multiple  performance  obligations.  For  such  arrangements,  we  allocate  revenues  to  each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.

## Customer Incentives and Credits

Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer incentives and credits.

## Sales Commissions

We expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain  sales  commissions  and  amortize  if  the  expected  benefit  period  is  greater  than  one  year. These  costs  are  recorded  within  sales  and marketing expenses.

## Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.

- TAC includes:
- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and
- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
- Other cost of revenues includes:
- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  providers  from  whom  we  license  video  and  other  content  for distribution,  primarily  related  to  YouTube  (we  pay  fees  to  these  content  providers  based  on  revenues  generated,  subscriber counts, or a flat fee);
- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;

<!-- page break -->

- employee  compensation  expenses  related  to  our  technical  infrastructure  and  other  operations  such  as  content  review  and customer and product support;
- inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and
- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.

## Software Development Costs

We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.

Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used  to  deliver  our  services.  We  capitalize  development  costs  related  to  these  software  applications  once  the  preliminary  project  stage  is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.

## Stock-based Compensation

Stock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. RSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares.

For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As  a  result,  fewer  shares  are  issued  than  the  number  of  RSUs  outstanding,  and  the  income  tax  withholding  is  recorded  as  a reduction to additional paid-in capital.

Additionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet company.

## Advertising and Promotional Expenses

We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $8.7 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.

## Performance Fees

Performance  fees  refer  to  compensation  arrangements  with  payouts  based  on  realized  returns  from  certain  investments.  We  record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&amp;E.

## Fair Value Measurements

Fair  value  is  an  exit  price,  representing  the  amount  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:

Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level  2  -  Inputs  that  are  based  upon  quoted  prices  for  similar  instruments  in  active  markets,  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar instruments  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  and  model-based  valuation  techniques  for  which  all  significant  inputs  are  observable  in  the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable,

<!-- page break -->

these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.

The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring  fair  value.  The  determination  of  fair  value  involves  the  use  of  appropriate  valuation  methods  and  relevant  inputs  into  valuation models.

Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.

We  measure  certain  other  instruments,  and  certain  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  in  a  business  combination,  also  at  fair  value  on  a nonrecurring basis.

## Financial Instruments

Our  financial  instruments  include  cash,  cash  equivalents,  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  derivative  financial  instruments, accounts receivable, and convertible notes.

## Credit Risks

We are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange  contracts,  accounts  receivable,  and  convertible  notes.  We  manage  our  credit  risk  exposure  through  timely  assessment  of  our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits, and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.

## Cash Equivalents

We invest excess cash primarily in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, government bonds, money market funds, and time deposits.

## Marketable Securities

We  classify  all  marketable  debt  securities  that  have  effective  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  from  the  date  of  purchase  as  cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized  gains  and  losses,  net  of  taxes,  as  a  component  of  stockholders'  equity,  except  for  the  changes  in  allowance  for  expected  credit losses, which are recorded in OI&amp;E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&amp;E. We determine any realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&amp;E.

Our  investments  in  marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  fair  value  with  the  related  gains  and  losses,  including  unrealized, recognized  in  OI&amp;E.  We  classify  our  marketable  equity  securities  subject  to  long-term  lock-up  restrictions  beyond  12  months  as  other  noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

## Non-Marketable Securities

Non-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. Other non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of OI&amp;E.

<!-- page break -->

Non-marketable  securities  that  do  not  have  effective  contractual  maturity  dates  are  classified  as  other  non-current  assets  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

See Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.

## Accounts Receivable

Our payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer.

We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes in such  are  classified  as  general  and  administrative  expense  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  We  assess  collectibility  by  reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customerspecific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.

## Convertible Notes

Our investments in convertible notes are primarily recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs,  and  any  related  discount  or  premium,  net  of  allowances  for  credit  losses,  and  are  included  within  other  non-current  assets  on  our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

## Other

Our financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into commercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the substance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value  of  the  components  of  the  arrangements,  including  the  fair  value  of  the  investments. Additionally,  if  our  investment  in  such  companies becomes impaired, we may need to re-evaluate the accounting for the commercial arrangement, including reducing any remaining performance obligations.

## Impairment of Investments

We periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.

For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by considering available  information  relevant  to  the  collectibility  of  the  security  and  information  about  past  events,  current  conditions,  and  reasonable  and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&amp;E, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of OI&amp;E.

For non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment indicators exist by evaluating the  companies'  financial  and  liquidity  position  and  access  to  capital  resources,  among  other  indicators.  If  the  assessment  indicates  that  the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&amp;E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.

## Inventory

Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method.

## Variable Interest Entities

We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are

<!-- page break -->

the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.

Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.

## Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets currently in service, and assets not  yet  in  service.  Technical  infrastructure  includes  data  center  land,  buildings  and  leasehold  improvements,  and  servers  and  network equipment. Office space includes office land, buildings and leasehold improvements. Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data center buildings and servers in the process of construction or assembly.

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets are ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and utilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings over periods of seven to 40 years.  We  depreciate  servers  and  network  equipment  generally  over  a  period  of  six  years.  We  depreciate  corporate  and  other  assets  over periods of two to 25 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated.

## Goodwill

We allocate  goodwill  to  reporting  units  based  on  the  expected  benefit  from  the  business  combination.  We  evaluate  our  reporting  units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value  allocation  approach.  We  test  our  goodwill  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.

## Leases

We  determine  if  an  arrangement  is  a  lease  at  inception.  Our  lease  agreements  generally  contain  lease  and  non-lease  components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.

Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for maintenance and utilities.

Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.

Lease  assets  and  liabilities  are  included  on  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  The  current  portion  of  our  operating  lease  liabilities  is included  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities,  and  the  long-term  portion  is  included  in  operating  lease  liabilities.  Finance  lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.

Operating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.

## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We  review  leases,  property  and  equipment,  and  intangible  assets,  excluding  goodwill,  for  impairment  when  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed

<!-- page break -->

at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.

## Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax income provision as a current period expense.

We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.

## Business Combinations

We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

## Foreign Currency

We translate  the  financial  statements  of  our  international  subsidiaries  to  U.S.  dollars  using  month-end  exchange  rates  for  assets  and liabilities, and average rates for the period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders' equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&amp;E.

## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topics  740):  Improvements  to  Income Tax  Disclosures"  to  expand  the  disclosure  requirements  for  income  taxes.  Upon  adoption  we  will  be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard can be applied either  prospectively  or  retrospectively.  We  will  adopt  the  standard  in  our  2025  annual  period  and  are  currently  assessing  the  effect  that  the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

In  November  2024,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2024-03  "Income  Statement:  Reporting  Comprehensive  Income-Expense  Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)" to improve the disclosures about an entity's expenses. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard  can  be  applied  either  prospectively  or  retrospectively.  We  are  currently  assessing  adoption  timing  and  the  effect  that  the  updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In  November  2023,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2023-07  'Segment  Reporting  (Topic  280):  Improvements  to  Reportable  Segment Disclosures' which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant  segment  expenses.  We  adopted  this ASU  for  our  2024  annual  period  with  the  comparative  periods  updated  to  reflect  additional disclosures. See Note 15 for further details.

## Revenue Backlog

As  of  December  31,  2024,  we  had  $93.2  billion  of  remaining  performance  obligations  ('revenue  backlog'),  primarily  related  to  Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect  to  recognize  approximately  half  of  the  revenue  backlog  as  revenues  over  the  next  24  months  with  the  remainder  to  be  recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.

## Deferred Revenues

## Fair Value Measurements

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.

Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&amp;E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

The following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are  classified  within  Level  2  or  Level  3  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy.  Non-marketable  equity  securities  that  have  been  remeasured  due  to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.

As  of  December  31,  2024,  the  carrying  value  of  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  was  $35.5  billion,  of  which  $19.9  billion  were remeasured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2024, and were primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.

## Equity Investments

The carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). Gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&amp;E. Certain of our non-marketable equity securities include our investments in VIE where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 5 for further details on VIE.

Unrealized gain (loss) on non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is comprised of $3.3 billion, $1.8 billion, and $5.6 billion of upward adjustments and $3.0 billion, $2.9 billion, and $2.2 billion of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. (1)

In the table above, realized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later.

Cumulative  net  gains  (losses)  on  equity  securities  sold  during  the  period,  which  is  summarized  in  the  following  table  (in  millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

## Equity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method

As  of  December  31,  2023  and  2024,  equity  securities  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  had  a  carrying  value  of  approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&amp;E. Certain of our equity method securities include our investments in VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for further details on VIEs.

## Convertible Notes

As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, we had investments in convertible notes of $921 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, the majority of which are convertible notes held for investment. Our convertible notes held for investment are recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.

We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair  values  and  present  all  other  derivatives  at  gross  fair  values. The  accounting  treatment  for  derivatives  is  based  on  the  intended  use  and hedge designation.

## Cash Flow Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.

Cash  flow  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred  in AOCI  and  subsequently  reclassified  to revenue  when  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in  earnings.  We  exclude  forward  points  and  time  value  from  our  assessment  of  hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.

As of December 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $731 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.

## Fair Value Hedges

We  designate  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  as  fair  value  hedges  to  hedge  foreign  currency  risks  for  our  marketable  securities denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Fair  value  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are recognized in OI&amp;E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&amp;E.

## Net Investment Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&amp;E.

## Other Derivatives

We  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  that  are  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  to  hedge  intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&amp;E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other derivatives are primarily reflected within the 'other' component of OI&amp;E. See Note 7 for further details.

These  leases  will  commence between 2025 and 2028 with non-cancelable lease terms between one and 25 years.

## Note 5. Variable Interest Entities

## Consolidated VIEs

<!-- page break -->

We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $8.7 billion,  respectively  and  are  primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.

Waymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $5.6 billion in funding during the year ended December 31, 2024, the majority of which was funded by Alphabet. Investments from external parties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in  capital.  Net  loss  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  was  not  material  for  any  period  presented  and  is  included  within  the  "other" component of OI&amp;E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&amp;E.

## Unconsolidated VIEs

We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources.

We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated  VIEs  is  generally  based  on  the  current  carrying  value  of  the  investments  and  any  future  funding  commitments.  As  of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.

## Note 6. Debt

## Short-Term Debt

We have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and $2.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.4% as of December 31, 2024.The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2024

Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.

Total outstanding long-term debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):

## Note 8. Business Combinations

## character.ai

In  accordance with the accounting requirements under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, for the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $2.7 billion of goodwill and $413 million of intangible assets resulting from a transaction with character.ai ('Character'). In August 2024, we entered into a license agreement with Character pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive license to its then current large language model technology. We paid Character $2.7 billion in cash and canceled our convertible instruments. We also hired certain employees of Character. Goodwill was recorded in Google Services and Google Cloud and is deductible for tax purposes.

## Note 9. Goodwill

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 were as follows (in millions):

## Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies

## Commitments

We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.

## Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  or  covenants,  or  out  of  intellectual  property  infringement  or  other  claims  made  against  certain  parties.  Several  of  these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.

It  is  not  possible  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  maximum  potential  amount  under  these  indemnification  agreements  due  to  the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.

## Legal Matters

We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.

Certain  outstanding  matters  seek  speculative,  substantial  or  indeterminate  monetary  amounts,  substantial  changes  to  our  business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.

We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.

## Antitrust Matters

We  are  subject  to  formal  and  informal  inquiries  and  investigations  as  well  as  litigation  on  various  competition  matters  by  regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the following:

- Shopping: In  June  2017,  the  EC  announced  its  decision  that  certain  actions  taken  by  Google  relating  to  its  display  and  ranking  of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a €2.4 billion fine. We appealed the EC decision and implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into

<!-- page break -->

compliance with the EC's decision. In September 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and upheld the €2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine.

- Android: In  July  2018,  the  EC  announced  its  decision  that  certain  provisions  in  Google's  Android-related  distribution  agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a €4.3 billion fine, and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.
- AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's agreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of €1.5 billion, and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners'  agreements,  which  we  implemented  prior  to  the  decision.  In  2019,  we  recognized  a  charge  of  $1.7  billion  for  the  fine  and appealed the EC decision. In September 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.
- Search: In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We expect a decision likely in the second half of 2025, after which we intend to appeal.

Further,  in  June  2022,  the  Australian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  and  in  October  2023,  the  Japanese  Fair  Trade Commission each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.

Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.

- Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District  of  Texas  alleging  that  Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  as  well  as  state  deceptive  trade  laws  relating  to  its  advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, in January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Virginia  alleging  that  Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws relating to its advertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit. The trial ended in September 2024, and we expect a decision in early 2025.

Further, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded.

Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.

- Google Play: In  July  2021,  a  number  of  state Attorneys  General  filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of California  alleging  that  Google's  operation  of Android  and  Google  Play  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  and  state  antitrust  and  consumer protection  laws.  In  September  2023,  we  reached  a  settlement  in  principle  with  50  state Attorneys  General  and  three  territories  and recognized a charge. Final approval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.

In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws related to  Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing  the  verdict  and  the  trial  court  judge  temporarily  paused  the  implementation  of  the  remedies  while  the  Court  of  Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.

<!-- page break -->

- European Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's compliance with certain provisions of  EU's  Digital  Markets Act  relating  to  Google  Play  and  Search.  Given  the  preliminary  stages  of  this  matter,  we  cannot  estimate  a possible loss.

In  addition  to  these  proceedings,  private  individual  and  collective  actions  that  overlap  with  claims  pursued  by  regulatory  authorities  are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions.

We believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.

## Privacy Matters

We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, alleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.

## Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services,  and  technologies  infringe  others'  intellectual  property  rights.  Adverse  results  in  these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  Because  the  U.S.  is  an  important  market,  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Further, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.

## Other

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral  related  civil  litigation  or  other  adverse  consequences,  all  of  which  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and operating results.

We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that include compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

## Non-Income Taxes

We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of nonincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions  and  the  tax  treatment  of  certain  employee  benefits.  We  accrue  non-income  taxes  that  may  result  from  examinations  by,  or  any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be  estimated,  we  disclose  the  reasonably  possible  loss.  Due  to  the  inherent  complexity  and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.

See Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.

## Note 11. Stockholders' Equity

## Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock

Our Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.

## Share Repurchases

In  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022,  2023,  and  2024,  we  continued  to  repurchase  both  Class A  and  Class  C  shares  in  a  manner deemed in  the  best  interest  of  the  company  and  its  stockholders,  taking  into  account  the  economic  cost  and  prevailing  market  conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and $62.0 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.

In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

|                             | Year Ended December 31, 2023   | Year Ended December 31, 2023   | Year Ended December 31, 2024   | Year Ended December 31, 2024   |

| Class A share repurchases   | 78                             | 9,316                          | 73                             | 11,855                         |
| Class C share repurchases   | 450                            | 52,868                         | 306                            | 50,192                         |
| Total share repurchases (1) | 528                            | 62,184                         | 379                            | 62,047                         |

Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases. (1)

Repurchases  are  executed  from  time  to  time,  subject  to  general  business  and  market  conditions  and  other  investment  opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

## Dividends

During the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash dividends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.

The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

## Note 12. Net Income Per Share

We compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist  of  RSUs  and  other  contingently  issuable  shares.  The  dilutive  effect  of  outstanding  RSUs  and  other  contingently  issuable  shares  is reflected  in  diluted  earnings  per  share  by  application  of  the  treasury  stock  method. The  computation  of  the  diluted  net  income  per  share  of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.

In accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment.

Immaterial  differences  in  net  income  per  share  across  our  Class A,  Class  B,  and  Class  C  shares  may  arise  due  to  the  allocation  of distributed earnings, which is based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the allocation of undistributed earnings and number of shares, which is based on the weighted average shares outstanding over the periods.

The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock (in millions, except per share amounts):

## Note 13. Compensation Plans

## Stock Plans

Our stock plans include the Alphabet Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan ("Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan") and Other Bets stock-based plans. Under our stock plans, RSUs and other types of awards may be granted. Under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan, an RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our Class C stock at the time the award vests. RSUs generally vest over four years contingent upon employment on the vesting date. RSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares.

As of December 31, 2024, there were 633 million shares of Class C stock reserved for future issuance under the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan.

## Stock-Based Compensation

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, total SBC expense was $19.5 billion, $22.1 billion, and $22.8 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $18.8 billion, $21.7 billion, and $22.0 billion, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we recognized tax benefits on total SBC expense, which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $3.9 billion, $4.5 billion, and $4.6 billion, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or exercised during the period was $4.7 billion, $5.6 billion, and $6.8 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include the indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the R&amp;D tax credit.

## Stock-Based Award Activities

The  following  table  summarizes  the  activities  for  unvested Alphabet  RSUs,  which  include  dividend  equivalents  awarded  to  holders  of unvested stock, for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except per share amounts):

The weighted-average grant-date  fair  value  of  RSUs  granted  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022  and  2023  was  $127.22  and $97.59, respectively. Total fair value of RSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, were $23.9 billion, $26.6 billion, and $33.3 billion, respectively.

In 2023, the IRS issued a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits as well as a separate rule change with guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&amp;D expenses. A cumulative onetime adjustment for these tax rule changes was recorded in 2023.

## Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):

|                                                      | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |

As of December 31, 2024, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $8.4 billion, $19.4 billion, and $2.5 billion respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033. It is more likely than not that the majority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.

As  of  December  31,  2024,  our  Federal  and  California  research  and  development  credit  carryforwards  for  income  tax  purposes  were approximately $700 million and $6.4 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&amp;D credit will begin to expire in 2037 and the California R&amp;D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the federal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized.

As of December 31, 2024, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were approximately $1.2 billion and will begin to expire in 2030. We use the flow-through method of accounting for investment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized.

As of December 31, 2024, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, certain federal net operating losses,  certain  state  net  operating  losses  and  tax  credits,  net  deferred  tax  assets  relating  to  Other  Bet  companies,  and  certain  foreign  net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We continue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.

Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $18.9 billion, $19.2 billion, and $27.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

|                                                      | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |

| Increases related to prior year tax positions        | 253                       | 740                       | 896                       |

| Increases related to current year tax positions      | 2,221                     | 2,346                     | 2,679                     |
| Ending gross unrecognized tax benefits               | $ 7,055                   | $ 9,438                   | $ 12,619                  |

We  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  evaluating  our  uncertain  tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.1 billion, $9.4 billion, and $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, of which $5.3 billion, $7.4 billion, and $10.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.

As  of  December  31,  2023  and  2024,  we  accrued  $622  million  and  $1.1  billion  in  interest  and  penalties  in  provision  for  income  taxes, respectively.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently  examining  our  2016  through  2021  tax  returns.  We  have  also  received  tax  assessments  in  multiple  foreign  jurisdictions  asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.

The tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.

We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.

We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax  audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are  resolved  in  a  manner  not  consistent  with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.

## Note 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:

- Google  Services  includes  products  and  services  such  as  ads, Android,  Chrome,  devices,  Google  Maps,  Google  Play,  Search,  and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.
- Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates  revenues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  received  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  services,  Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.
- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.

As  announced  in  April  2024,  we  consolidated  teams  that  focus  on  building  general  AI  models  across  Google  Research  and  Google DeepMind to further accelerate our progress in AI.  General AI  model  development  teams  previously  under  Google  Research  in  our  Google Services segment are reported within Alphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024. As further announced, in October 2024, the Gemini app team that is developing the direct consumer interface to our Gemini models joined Google DeepMind. The costs associated with the Gemini app team continue to be reported within our Google Services segment.

Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include certain AIfocused shared R&amp;D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with  employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.

Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses segment operating income (loss)  to  allocate  resources  to  our  segments  in  our  annual  planning  process  and  to  assess  the  performance  of  our  segments,  primarily  by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

The following table presents revenue, profitability, and expense information about our segments (in millions):

## ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

## ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on  the  framework  in Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst &amp; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure  controls  and  procedures  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints  and  that  management  is  required  to  apply  its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Hennessy Revocable Trust adopted a trading plan on November 5, 2024 (with the first trade under the plan scheduled for March 13, 2025).

Trading and actual sale transactions made pursuant to such trading arrangements will be disclosed publicly in Section 16 filings with the SEC in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations.

## Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to current and future holders of all unvested stock units in connection with any regular cash dividend that may be declared by the Board of Directors of Alphabet from time to time. As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends, the crediting of dividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the company when the stock units were granted and to treat the holders of unvested stock units consistently with all stockholders.

## Required Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act

As previously disclosed, Google LLC, a subsidiary of Alphabet, filed notifications with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) pursuant to Russian encryption control requirements, which must be complied with prior to the import of covered items.

## Alphabet's Policy Against Insider Trading

Employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries (' Alphabet '), their immediate family members (e.g., spouses, domestic partners, children, and parents) or other people living in the same household, and their controlled entities (trusts that they control or benefit from, or partnerships or other entities they control) (collectively, ' Covered Persons ') may not do any of the following:

- trade securities of Alphabet while having material nonpublic information related to Alphabet, unless the trade is made through Alphabet's Employee Trading Plan program [link] or a plan approved under Alphabet's 10b5-1 Trading Plan Guidelines [link],
- trade securities of any other company while having material nonpublic information about or that may affect that company acquired through an Alphabet role or relationship,
- 'tip' others about material nonpublic information that involves Alphabet or other companies and that was gained through an Alphabet role or relationship, or
- otherwise violate insider trading laws.

This Policy applies until a Covered Person is no longer providing services to Alphabet and no longer has any material nonpublic information subject to this Policy.

Consultants and contractors working with Alphabet are not directly subject to this Policy, but should comply with applicable securities laws against insider trading, as well as contractual obligations regarding the handling of Alphabet confidential information.

## Definitions

' Material ' Information is information a reasonable investor would consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell securities. Either positive or negative information may be material. As a general rule, information likely to affect the market price of a security is likely material.

Some examples of the types of information that may be material:

- Financial results
- News of a pending or proposed merger, acquisition or disposition
- Significant developments involving major corporate relationships, such as joint ventures and other strategic partnerships
- Changes in dividend policy
- Proposed stock splits
- New product announcements of a significant nature
- Significant cybersecurity incidents
- New equity or debt offerings
- Positive or negative developments in litigation or investigations
- Major changes to senior management

<!-- page break -->

Financial information is particularly likely to be material. For example, nonpublic information about the results of Alphabet's operations for even part of a quarter might be material in helping to predict Alphabet's results for the quarter.

' Nonpublic ' information is information that has not been widely disseminated to the public market long enough for the public to absorb and evaluate it.

' Securities ' of Alphabet or other companies include equity securities (e.g., Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class C capital stock), restricted stock units, performance stock units, stock options, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, convertible debentures, and derivative securities (including exchange-traded options).

' Tipping ' is sharing material nonpublic information with another person or making recommendations or expressing opinions about trading in the impacted securities on the basis of such information (even if the information itself is not shared).

' Trading ' includes directly or indirectly buying, selling, pledging, or otherwise acquiring or disposing of securities, as well as agreeing to do any of these things. While bona fide gifts and donations are generally permitted during open trading windows, a gift of securities can constitute trading if there is an arrangement (written or otherwise) with the recipient to sell such securities.

## Other Restrictions

## Trading Windows

Employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries and their controlled entities may not trade, give, or donate Alphabet securities when their applicable trading window is closed unless they do so through Alphabet's Employee Trading Plan program [link] or under a plan approved under Alphabet's 10b5-1 Trading Plan Guidelines [link]

Trading windows for Alphabet employees depend on their level:

- The quarterly trading window for individuals at Employee Level 8 (Directors) and above (including officers and directors) and their controlled entities opens on the second trading day following the public disclosure of Alphabet's financial results for the prior fiscal quarter and ends at the close of market on the first trading day of the third calendar month of the current quarter.
- The quarterly trading window for individuals at Employee Level 7 and below and their controlled entities opens on the second trading day following the public disclosure of Alphabet's financial results for the previous fiscal quarter and ends at the close of market on the first trading day of the next fiscal quarter.

<!-- page break -->

Even during an open trading window, employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries (and their controlled entities) with material nonpublic information relating to Alphabet may not trade Alphabet securities until at least the second trading day after such information becomes public.

Alphabet's Insider Trading Compliance Officer may designate special trading restriction periods for individuals having material nonpublic information, such as news of a pending material acquisition. Alphabet will notify individuals subject to a special trading restriction. Those persons may not inform others of the notification or any material inside information, and they (and their controlled entities) may not engage in any transaction involving Alphabet's securities until instructed otherwise by the Insider Trading Compliance Officer.

Alphabet's quarterly trading windows and special trading restriction periods do not apply to family members or other persons living in the same household as the employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries. However, any family members and other persons living in the same household as the employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries are strongly advised to adhere to the applicable trading window as well as any special trading restriction periods that may apply to the employees, officers, and directors of Alphabet or its subsidiaries.

Alphabet's Insider Trading Compliance Officer has the authority to determine who will be subject to Alphabet's trading windows, and may modify the list of Alphabet persons subject to the quarterly trading windows and/or special trading restriction periods from time to time.

## Other Prohibited Transactions

Covered Persons may not engage in short-term ('in and out') trading, short sales, hedging, or other derivative transactions involving Alphabet securities, pledge Alphabet securities as collateral, hold Alphabet securities in margin accounts, or place limit orders or stop orders for Alphabet securities that are likely to remain open during a closed trading window or other restricted period.

## clearance

Outside of an approved 10b5-1 trading program, members of Alphabet's Board of Directors and all of Alphabet's Section 16 officers may not trade Alphabet's securities, even during an open trading window, without first having the transaction pre-cleared by Alphabet's Insider Trading Compliance Officer.

## Exemptions

These restrictions do not apply to the: (i) exercise of Alphabet stock options when the exercise price is paid in cash ('cashless' exercises of stock options are covered by this Policy); (ii) transactions involving only a change in the form of ownership (e.g., a person transferring shares to a trust of which he or she is the sole beneficiary); (iii) mandatory sales of shares under non-US stock award agreements or under 409A exercise elections; or (iv) grants of stock, options, or restricted stock units from Alphabet.

<!-- page break -->

## Policy Violations

Individuals who trade on material nonpublic information (or tip such information to others) are subject to civil and criminal penalties. Violations of this Policy by Alphabet employees may also result in demotion, termination, or other disciplinary actions. This Policy goes beyond legal requirements, and Alphabet may determine that specific conduct violates this Policy, even if it does not violate the law, and may take disciplinary action prior to the filing or resolution of any civil or criminal action against the alleged violator.
