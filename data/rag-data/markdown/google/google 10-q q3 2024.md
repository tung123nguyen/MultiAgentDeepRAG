## Note About Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding:

- the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success and trends in our business;
- fluctuations in our revenues and margins and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
- our expectation that the continuing shift from an offline to online world will continue to benefit our business;
- our expectation that the portion of our revenues that we derive beyond advertising will continue to increase and may affect our margins;
- our expectation that our traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and the associated TAC rate will fluctuate, which could affect our overall margins;
- our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins;
- fluctuations in paid clicks and cost-per-click as well as impressions and cost-per-impression, and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
- our expectation that we will continue to periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and impressions;
- our  expectation  that  our  results  will  be  affected  by  our  performance  in  international  markets  as  users  in  developing  economies increasingly come online;
- our  expectation  that  our  foreign  exchange  risk  management  program  will  not  fully  offset  our  net  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign currency exchange rates;
- the expected variability of gains and losses related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program;
- the  amount  and  timing  of  revenue  recognition  from  customer  contracts  with  commitments  for  performance  obligations,  including  our estimate of the remaining amount of commitments and when we expect to recognize revenue;
- our expectation that our capital expenditures will increase, including the expected increase in our technical infrastructure investment to support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  our  long-term  initiatives,  in  particular  in  support  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  products  and services;
- our plans to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and systems, as well as to continue to invest in acquisitions and strategic investments;
- our pace of hiring and our plans to provide competitive compensation programs;
- our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development (R&amp;D) expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses may increase in amount and/or may increase as a percentage of revenues and may be affected by a number of factors;
- estimates of our future compensation expenses;
- our expectation that our other income (expense), net (OI&amp;E), will fluctuate in the future, as it is largely driven by market dynamics;
- our expectation that our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years;
- seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;
- the sufficiency of our sources of funding;
- our potential exposure in connection with new and pending investigations, proceedings, and other contingencies, including the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results;
- our  expectation  that  we  will  continue  to  face  heightened  regulatory  scrutiny,  and  changes  in  regulatory  conditions,  laws,  and  public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results;

## Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

## Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Nature of Operations

Google  was  incorporated  in  California  in  September  1998  and  re-incorporated  in  the  State  of  Delaware  in August  2003.  In  2015,  we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure  and  platform  services  as  well  as  communication  and  collaboration  tools;  sales  of  other  products  and  services,  such  as  fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.

## Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

## Unaudited Interim Financial Information

These  unaudited  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles  in  the  United  States  (GAAP),  and  in  our  opinion,  include  all  adjustments  of  a  normal  recurring  nature  necessary  for  fair  financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

These  consolidated  financial  statements  and  other  information  presented  in  this  Form  10-Q  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In  November  2023,  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  2023-07  "Segment Reporting  (Topic  280):  Improvements  to  Reportable  Segment  Disclosures"  which  expands  annual  and  interim  disclosure  requirements  for reportable  segments,  primarily  through  enhanced  disclosures  about  significant  segment  expenses. ASU  2023-07  is  effective  for  our  annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose standardized categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. ASU 2023-09 will also require income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. We will adopt ASU 2023-09 for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025.

## Prior Period Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

## Revenue Backlog

As of  September 30, 2024, we had $86.8 billion of remaining performance obligations ('revenue backlog'), primarily  related  to  Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.

## Deferred Revenues

We record  deferred  revenues  when  cash  payments  are  received  or  due  in  advance  of  our  performance,  including  amounts  which  are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $3.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

## Fair Value Measurements

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets

<!-- page break -->

or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.

Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&amp;E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

The following  tables  summarize  our  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  marketable  securities  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis  (in millions):

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are  classified  within  Level  2  or  Level  3  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy.  Non-marketable  equity  securities  that  have  been  remeasured  due  to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.

As  of  September  30,  2024,  the  carrying  value  of  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  was  $33.7  billion,  of  which  $13.7  billion  were remeasured at  fair  value  during  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2024  and  were  primarily  classified  within  Level  2  of  the  fair  value hierarchy at the time of measurement.

## Equity Investments

The carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). Gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on OI&amp;E. Certain of our non-marketable equity securities include our investments in variable interest entities (VIE) where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for further details on variable interest entities.

The carrying values for marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions):

Unrealized gain (loss) on non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is comprised of $599 million and $1.9 billion of upward adjustments and $783 million and $412 million of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $1.6 billion and $5.0 billion of upward adjustments and $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. (1)

In the table above, realized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later.

Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected  in  periods  prior  to  the  period  of  sale,  we  believe  they  are  important  supplemental  information  as  they  reflect  the economic net gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

## Equity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method

As  of  December  31,  2023  and  September  30,  2024,  equity  securities  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  had  a  carrying  value  of approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on OI&amp;E. Certain of our equity method securities include our investments in VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for further details on VIEs.

## Convertible Notes

As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had investments in convertible notes of $921 million and $2.8 billion, respectively, majority  of  which  are  convertible  notes  held  for  investment.  Our  convertible  notes  held  for  investment  are  recorded  at  amortized  cost  which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.

We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair  values  and  present  all  other  derivatives  at  gross  fair  values. The  accounting  treatment  for  derivatives  is  based  on  the  intended  use  and hedge designation.

## Cash Flow Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.

Cash  flow  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred  in  AOCI  and  subsequently  reclassified  to revenue  when  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in  earnings.  We  exclude  forward  points  and  time  value  from  our  assessment  of  hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.

As of September 30, 2024, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $433 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.

## Fair Value Hedges

We  designate  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  as  fair  value  hedges  to  hedge  foreign  currency  risks  for  our  marketable  securities denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Fair  value  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are recognized in OI&amp;E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded     component in OI&amp;E.

## Net Investment Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&amp;E.

## Other Derivatives

We  enter  into  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  that  are  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  to  hedge  intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&amp;E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

<!-- page break -->

We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other derivatives are primarily reflected within the 'other' component of OI&amp;E. See Note 6 for further details.

## Offsetting of Derivatives

We enter into master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements to reduce credit risk. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets.

The gross amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting arrangements with various counterparties, and cash and non-cash collateral received and pledged under such agreements were as follows (in millions):

## Note 4. Variable Interest Entities

## Consolidated VIEs

We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively and are primarily  included  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  on  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets. As  of  December  31,  2023  and  September  30,  2024, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.

Waymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $4.8 billion in funding during the three months ended September 30, 2024, followed by an additional $860 million in October 2024. The majority of the total funding of $5.6 billion was provided by Alphabet. Investments from external parties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.

As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the "other" component of OI&amp;E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&amp;E.

## Unconsolidated VIEs

We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources.

We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated  VIEs  is  generally  based  on  the  current  carrying  value  of  the  investments  and  any  future  funding  commitments.  As  of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

## Note 5. Debt

## Short-Term Debt

We have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.8% as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of September 30, 2024.

Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.

Future finance lease payments are net of imputed interest. (1)

Total current portion of long-term debt is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities. See Note 6 for further details. (2)

The notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semiannually.

The total  estimated  fair  value  of  the  outstanding  notes  was  approximately  $10.3  billion  and  $9.5  billion  as  of  December  31,  2023  and September 30, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

## Credit Facility

As of September 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April 2025 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

## Note 6. Supplemental Financial Statement Information

## Accounts Receivable

## Note 7. Business Combinations

## character.ai

In  accordance  with  the  accounting  requirements  under  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  805,  during  the  three  months  ended September 30, 2024, we recorded $2.7 billion of goodwill and $413 million of intangible assets resulting from a transaction with character.ai ('Character'). In August 2024, we entered into a license agreement with Character pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive license to its current large language model technology. We paid Character $2.7 billion in cash and canceled our convertible instruments. We also hired certain employees of Character. Goodwill was recorded in Google Services and Google Cloud and is deductible for tax purposes.

## Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies

## Commitments

We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $9.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.

## Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  or  covenants,  or  out  of  intellectual  property  infringement  or  other  claims  made  against  certain  parties.  Several  of  these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.

It  is  not  possible  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  maximum  potential  amount  under  these  indemnification  agreements  due  to  the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.

## Legal Matters

We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.

Certain  outstanding  matters  seek  speculative,  substantial  or  indeterminate  monetary  amounts,  substantial  changes  to  our  business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal

<!-- page break -->

matters  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  subject  to  significant  uncertainties,  and  could,  either  individually  or  in  aggregate,  have  a  material adverse effect.

We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.

## Antitrust Matters

On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related  complaints against us.

- On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. We appealed the EC decision and implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and upheld the €2.4 billion fine imposed in 2017. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.
- On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.
- On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. On September 18, 2024, the European Union's (EU) General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.

In  addition,  on  July  7,  2021,  a  number  of  state Attorneys  General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.

In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google . The jury found that Google violated antitrust  laws  related  to  Google  Play's  business.  Epic  did  not  seek  monetary  damages. The  presiding  judge  issued  a  remedies  decision  on October 7, 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a motion to pause the implementation of some of the remedies pending the appeal. The trial court judge has temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal.

From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their nature we cannot estimate a possible loss include:

- In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and on August 5, 2024, the U.S. District Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia  ruled  that  Google  violated  such  antitrust  laws. A  separate  proceeding  is  being  held  to  determine remedies, the range of which vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  statements.  Further,  in  June  2022,  the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.

<!-- page break -->

- On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust  complaint  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Virginia  alleging  that  Google's  digital  advertising  technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint. The trial ended on September 27, 2024, and we expect a decision in late 2024 or early 2025. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal  investigation  into  Google's  advertising  technology  business  practices  on  June  22,  2021,  May  25,  2022,  and  June  29,  2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023. On September 6, 2024, the CMA issued an SO informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated UK competition laws relating to its advertising technology. We will respond to the SO.
- In  May  2022,  the  EC  and  the  CMA  each  opened  investigations  into  Google  Play's  business  practices.  The  EC  closed  its  initial investigation, but is now investigating Google Play's compliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.

We believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.

## Privacy Matters

We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.

## Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services,  and  technologies  infringe  others'  intellectual  property  rights.  Adverse  results  in  these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  Because  the  U.S.  is  an  important  market,  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.

Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.

## Other

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods  and  services  offered  by  advertisers  or  publishers  using  our  platforms,  personal  injury,  consumer  protection,  and  other  matters.  For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory  and  government  investigations,  and  other  proceedings  could  result  in  substantial  fines  and  penalties,  injunctive  relief,  ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon  us  in  connection  with  disputes  regarding  the  termination  of  accounts,  including  those  of  sanctioned  parties.  We  do  not  believe  these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

## Non-Income Taxes

We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of nonincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions  and  the  tax  treatment  of  certain  employee  benefits.  We  accrue  non-income  taxes  that  may  result  from  examinations  by,  or  any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be  estimated,  we  disclose  the  reasonably  possible  loss.  Due  to  the  inherent  complexity  and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.

See Note 13 for information regarding income tax contingencies.

## Note 10. Stockholders' Equity

## Share Repurchases

In  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2024,  we  continued  to  repurchase  both  Class A  and  Class  C  shares  in  a  manner deemed in  the  best  interest  of  the  company  and  its  stockholders,  taking  into  account  the  economic  cost  and  prevailing  market  conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased $15.3 billion and $47.0 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.

In April  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  of Alphabet  authorized  the  company  to  repurchase  up  to  $70.0  billion  of  its  Class A  and  Class  C shares. Repurchases made pursuant to the April 2023 authorization were completed during the third quarter of 2024. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2024, $59.7 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

Not applicable for consolidated net income per share. (1)

For  the  periods  presented  above,  the  holders  of  each  class  are  entitled  to  equal  per  share  dividends  or  distributions  in  liquidation  in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc. Holders of Alphabet unvested stock units are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares.

Immaterial  differences  in  net  income  per  share  across  our  Class A,  Class  B,  and  Class  C  shares  may  arise  due  to  the  allocation  of distributed earnings based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the allocation of undistributed earnings and number of shares based on weighted average over the periods.

## Note 12. Compensation Plans

## Stock-Based Compensation

For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, total stock based compensation (SBC) expense was $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.

## Stock-Based Award Activities

The  following  table  summarizes  the  activities  for  unvested  Alphabet  restricted  stock  units  (RSUs),  which  include  dividend  equivalents awarded to holders of unvested stock, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions, except per share amounts):

|                                   | Number of Shares   | Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Unvested as of December 31, 2023  | 338                | $ 104.93                                  |
| Granted                           | 185                | $ 138.23                                  |
| Vested                            | (150)              | $ 110.04                                  |
| Forfeited/canceled                | (29)               | $ 112.01                                  |
| Unvested as of September 30, 2024 | 344                | $ 119.95                                  |

As of September 30, 2024, there was $39.6 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.

## Note 13. Income Taxes

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):

| Income before provision for income taxes | $ 21,197                           | $ 31,706                           | $ 61,305                          | $ 87,572                          |
| Provision for income taxes               | $ 1,508                            | $ 5,405                            | $ 8,197                           | $ 13,990                          |
| Effective tax rate                       | 7.1%                               | 17.0%                              | 13.4%                             | 16.0%                             |

We  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  evaluating  our  uncertain  tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $9.4 billion and $12.0 billion, of  which  $7.4  billion  and  $9.5  billion,  if  recognized,  would  affect  our  effective  tax  rate,  as  of  December  31,  2023  and  September  30,  2024, respectively.

## Note 14. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:

- Google  Services  includes  products  and  services  such  as  ads, Android,  Chrome,  devices,  Google  Maps,  Google  Play,  Search,  and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.
- Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration  tools,  and  other  services  for  enterprise  customers.  Google Cloud  generates  revenues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  received  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.
- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are

<!-- page break -->

managed  centrally  at  a  consolidated  level.  These  costs,  including  the  associated  depreciation  and  impairment,  are  allocated  to  operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.

As announced on April 18, 2024, we further consolidated teams that focus on building AI models across Google Research and Google DeepMind to further accelerate our progress in AI. AI model development teams previously under Google Research in our Google Services segment are included as part of Google DeepMind, reported within Alphabet-level activities, prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024.

Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&amp;D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared  costs  such  as  certain  finance,  human  resource,  and  legal  costs,  including  certain  fines  and  settlements.  Charges  associated  with employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.

Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

## ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with "Note About ForwardLooking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," as updated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results

Alphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Revenues and Monetization Metrics

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in "Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:

- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
- changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;
- general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;
- new product and service launches; and
- seasonality.

Additionally,  fluctuations  in  our  revenues  generated  from  advertising  ("Google  advertising"),  revenues  from  other  sources  ("Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.

## Google Services

Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues.

## Google Advertising

Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following:

- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their  default  search  in  browsers,  toolbars,  etc.),  and  other  Google  owned  and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and
- Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to  traffic  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties,  while  impressions  and  cost-per-impression  pertain  to  traffic  on  our Google Network properties.

<!-- page break -->

Paid clicks  represent  engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google  owned  and  operated  properties  including  Gmail,  Google  Maps,  and  Google  Play.  Cost-per-click  is  defined  as  click-driven  revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.

Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.

Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &amp; other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as:

- advertiser competition for keywords;
- changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;
- changes in device mix;
- seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and
- traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.

## Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices

Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:

- consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;
- platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;
- devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and
- other products and services.

Fluctuations  in  our  Google  subscriptions,  platforms,  and  devices  revenues  have  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  affected  by  factors  in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:

- Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure,  platform,  and  other  services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud;
- Google  Workspace,  which  includes  subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and
- other enterprise services.

Fluctuations  in  our  Google  Cloud  revenues  have  been,  and  may  continue  to  be,  affected  by  factors  in  addition  to  the  general  factors described above, such as customer usage.

## Other Bets

Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

## Costs and Expenses

Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in particular due to annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.

## Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.

- TAC includes:
- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and
- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
- Other cost of revenues primarily includes:
- compensation expense related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content review and customer and product support;
- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  providers  from  whom  we  license  video  and  other  content  for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);
- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;
- inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and
- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including bandwidth, energy, and equipment costs.

TAC  as  a  percentage  of  revenues  generated  from  ads  placed  on  Google  Network  properties  are  significantly  higher  than  TAC  as  a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.

## Operating Expenses

Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.

The main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:

- compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&amp;D related to our existing and new products and services;
- depreciation; and
- third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts.

The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:

- compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and
- spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.

The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:

- compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions;
- expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and
- third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

OI&amp;E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.

For  additional  information,  including  how  we  account  for  our  investments  and  factors  that  can  drive  fluctuations  in  the  value  of  our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  The  provision  includes  the  effect  of  reserve  provisions  and  changes  to  reserves  that  are  considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Google Services

## Google advertising revenues

## Google Search &amp; other

Google Search &amp; other revenues increased $5.4 billion and $17.0 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.

## YouTube ads

YouTube ads revenues increased $969 million and $3.4 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The growth was driven by our brand advertising products followed by our direct response advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers.

## Google Network

Google Network revenues decreased $121 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in AdSense revenues.

Google Network revenues decreased $610 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in AdMob revenues.

Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.

Changes  in  cost-per-click  and  cost-per-impression  are  driven  by  a  number  of  interrelated  factors  including  changes  in  device  mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

## Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices

Google  subscriptions,  platforms,  and  devices  revenues  increased  $2.3  billion  and  $4.8  billion  from  the  three  and  nine  months  ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The growth was primarily driven by increases in subscriptions  and  devices  revenues. The  increase  in  subscriptions  revenues  was  largely  from  growth  in  the  number  of  paid  subscribers  for YouTube services and to a lesser extent for Google One. The increase in devices revenues was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices, due to Pixel family product launch timing in the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud revenues increased $2.9 billion and $7.4 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine  months  ended  September  30,  2024,  respectively.  The  growth  was  primarily  driven  by  Google  Cloud  Platform  followed  by  Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.

## Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information

International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use nonGAAP  constant  currency  revenues  ("constant  currency  revenues")  and  non-GAAP  percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.  We  believe  the  presentation  of  results  on  a  constant  currency  basis  in  addition  to  GAAP  results  helps  improve  the  ability  to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.

Constant  currency  information  compares  results  between  periods  as  if  exchange  rates  had  remained  constant  period  over  period.  We define  constant  currency  revenues  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements  ("FX  Effect")  as  well  as hedging  activities,  which  are  recognized  at  the  consolidated  level.  We  use  constant  currency  revenues  to  determine  the  constant  currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.

Constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  is  calculated  by  determining  the  change  in  current  period  revenues  over  prior  year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.

These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

EMEA  revenue  growth  was  unfavorably  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  primarily  due  to  the  U.S.  dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira.

APAC  revenue  growth  was  unfavorably  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  primarily  due  to  the  U.S.  dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.

Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real.

EMEA  revenue  growth  was  not  materially  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  as  the  effect  of  the  U.S.  dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira was largely offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the British pound.

APAC  revenue  growth  was  unfavorably  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  primarily  due  to  the  U.S.  dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.

Other Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.

## Cost of Revenues

The following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):

|                                                    | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   |

| Other cost of revenues                             | 20,587                             | 22,755                             | 58,857                            | 65,641                            |
| Total cost of revenues                             | $ 33,229                           | $ 36,474                           | $ 95,757                          | $ 105,693                         |
| Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues | 43%                                | 41%                                | 43%                               | 42%                               |

Cost of revenues increased $3.2 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $2.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Cost of revenues increased $9.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $6.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.

The increase in TAC from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was  largely  due  to  an  increase  in  TAC  paid  to  distribution  partners,  primarily  driven  by  growth  in  revenues  subject  to  TAC.  The  TAC  rate decreased  from  21.2%  to  20.8%  from  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2023  to  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2024  and decreased from 21.4% to 20.8% from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search &amp; other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search &amp; other revenues increased from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increases related to mobile searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The TAC rate on Google Network revenues was substantially consistent from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, depreciation expense, and devices costs, due to Pixel family product launch timing in the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year.

The increase in other cost of revenues from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, depreciation expense, other technical infrastructure operations costs,  and  third-party  service  fees. Additionally,  devices  costs  contributed  to  the  increase  in  other  cost  of  revenues  due  to  the  Pixel  family product launch timing in the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year.

## Research and Development

R&amp;D expenses increased $1.2 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses of $358 million, depreciation expense of $353 million, and charges related to our office space optimization efforts of $188 million. The increase in compensation expenses was largely due to an increase in SBC expense of $214 million.

R&amp;D expenses increased $2.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases in depreciation expense of $993 million, compensation expenses of $879 million, and third-party services fees of $597  million.  The  increase  in  compensation  expenses  was  primarily  driven  by  a  $1.0  billion  increase  in  SBC  expenses,  which  reflects  the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by a $554 million decrease in severance and related charges.

(1) In addition to the costs included in Alphabet-level activities, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue were $(1) million and $17 million for the three months ended  September  30,  2023  and  2024,  respectively,  and  $86  million  and  $191  million  for  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2023  and  2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, Alphabet-level activities included substantially all of the charges related to employee severance and our office space optimization efforts. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we incurred office space charges totaling $607 million.

## Google Services

Google Services operating income increased $6.9 billion and $19.3 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in TAC and content acquisition costs. Additionally, a reduction in compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud operating income increased $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2024,  respectively.  The  increase  in  operating  income  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in revenues, partially offset by increases in usage costs for technical infrastructure assets as well as compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth.

## Other Bets

Other Bets operating loss decreased $78 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.

Other Bets operating loss increased $38 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in expenses, largely driven by compensation expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenues. The increase in compensation expenses was primarily as a result of the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period.

OI&amp;E  increased  $3.3  billion  from  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2023  to  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2024.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and market driven changes, and increased net gains on debt securities.

OI&amp;E increased $5.4 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  net  unrealized  gains  on  non-marketable  equity  securities  driven  by  fair  value  adjustments  related  to observable transactions and increased interest income related to higher interest rates.

## Provision for Income Taxes

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):

|                                          | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|                                          | 2023                               | 2024                               | 2023                              | 2024                              |
| Income before provision for income taxes | $ 21,197                           | $ 31,706                           | $ 61,305                          | $ 87,572                          |
| Provision for income taxes               | $ 1,508                            | $ 5,405                            | $ 8,197                           | $ 13,990                          |
| Effective tax rate                       | 7.1%                               | 17.0%                              | 13.4%                             | 16.0%                             |

The effective tax rate increased from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a cumulative one-time adjustment recorded for tax rule changes issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction in 2024 contributed to the higher effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a one-time adjustment for tax rule changes issued by the IRS in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation-related tax benefits in 2024.

The OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to  international  tax  policies,  including  the  implementation  of  a  minimum  global  effective  tax  rate  of  15%.  Some  countries  have  already implemented the legislation effective  January  1,  2024,  and  we  expect  others  to  follow,  however  we  do  not  expect  a  material  change  to  our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As additional jurisdictions enact such legislation, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.

## Financial Condition

## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities

As of September 30, 2024, we had $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgagebacked and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities.

## Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.

The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):

|                                           | Nine Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|                                           | 2023                              | 2024                              |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 82,831                          | $ 86,186                          |
| Net cash used in investing activities     | $ (20,896)                        | $ (29,356)                        |
| Net cash used in financing activities     | $ (52,785)                        | $ (60,697)                        |

## Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Our  largest  source  of  cash  provided  by  operations  are  advertising  revenues  generated  by  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties,  Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app  purchases,  and  devices.  In  Google  Cloud,  we  generate  cash  through  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools, and other cloud services.

Our  primary  uses  of  cash  from  operating  activities  include  payments  to  distribution  and  Google  Network  partners,  to  employees  for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities

<!-- page break -->

include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in tax payments and a cash payment for the 2017 EC shopping fine. The increase in tax payments in comparison to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California.

## Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash  used  in  investing  activities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  purchases  of  property  and equipment, and payments for acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets.

Net cash used in investing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities.

## Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  consists  primarily  of  proceeds  from  issuance  of  debt  and  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  interests  in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to dividend payments and net payments related to stock-based award activities.

## Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities  and  cash  commitments  for  investing  and  financing  activities  for  at  least  the  next  12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

## Capital Expenditures and Leases

We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.

## Capital Expenditures

Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:

- technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and
- office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").

Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction  projects  are  generally  multi-year  projects  with  multiple  phases,  where  we  acquire  land  and  buildings,  construct  buildings,  and secure and install information technology assets.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we spent $21.2 billion and $38.3 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2023  and  2024,  our  depreciation  on  property  and  equipment  was  $8.6  billion  and  $11.1  billion, respectively.

## Leases

<!-- page break -->

For  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2023  and  2024,  we  recognized  total  operating  lease  assets  of  $2.4  billion  and  $1.6  billion, respectively. As  of  September  30,  2024,  the  amount  of  total  future  lease  payments  under  operating  leases,  which  had  a  weighted  average remaining lease term of 7.8 years, was $17.1 billion.

As of September 30, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $6.1 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2027 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.

## Financing

We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we had $1.0 billion of short-term commercial paper outstanding.

As of September 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.

As  of  September  30,  2024,  we  had  senior  unsecured  notes  outstanding  with  a  total  carrying  value  of  $11.9  billion.  For  additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Share Repurchase Program

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 90 million and 293 million shares for $15.3 billion and $47.0 billion, respectively.

In April  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  of Alphabet  authorized  the  company  to  repurchase  up  to  $70.0  billion  of  its  Class A  and  Class  C shares. Repurchases made pursuant to the April 2023 authorization were completed during the third quarter of 2024. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2024, $59.7 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

|                             | Three Months Ended September 30, 2024   | Three Months Ended September 30, 2024   | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024   | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024   |

## European Commission Fines

In  2017,  2018,  and  2019,  the  EC  announced  decisions  that  certain  actions  taken  by  Google  infringed  European  competition  law  and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively.

On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.

On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal of the 2017 decision and upheld the €2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.

On  September  18,  2024,  the  EU's  General  Court  overturned  the  2019  decision  and  annulled  the  €1.5  billion  fine.  The  EC  has  until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.

We included  the  EC  fines,  including  any  under  appeal,  in  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities  on  our  Consolidated  Balance Sheets,  as  we  provided  bank  guarantees  (in  lieu  of  a  cash  payment)  for  the  fines.  For  additional  information,  see  Note  9  of  the  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Taxes

As of September 30, 2024, we had short-term income taxes payable of $2.7 billion, related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the remaining transition tax installment in 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable of $8.2 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024.

## Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations

As of September 30, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $50.8 billion, of which $31.1 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the  minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of September 30, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing  of  order  fulfillment  from  our  suppliers.  For  more  information  related  to  our  content  licenses,  see  Note  9  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable  energy  certificates.  These  agreements  do  not  include  a  minimum  dollar  commitment.  The  amounts  to  be  paid  under  these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

For  quantitative  and  qualitative  disclosures  about  market  risk,  refer  to  Part  II,  Item  7A,  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure  controls  and  procedures  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints  and  that  management  is  required  to  apply  its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

## PART II.     OTHER INFORMATION

## ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 9 'Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters' of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.

## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

We are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability, including competition matters, that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We  are  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  regulatory  and  government  inquiries  and  investigations,  other  proceedings,  and  orders  involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.

The DOJ, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file in the future, several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store.

For example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google violated antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. The  Court  is  holding  a  separate  proceeding  to  determine  remedies,  which  could  include  alterations  to  our  products  and  services  and  our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal, there can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of any remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Also, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision on October 7, 2024 that ordered a variety of alterations to our business models  and  operations  and  contractual  agreements  for Android  and  Google  Play.  We  are  appealing  and  have  filed  a  motion  to  pause  the implementation of some of the remedies pending the appeal, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal or in our efforts to pause the implementation of the remedies pending the appeal. If we are unsuccessful, we could face significant expenses to implement the remedies, and such costs and alterations could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Other  regulatory  agencies  in  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world,  including  competition  enforcers,  consumer  protection  agencies,  and  data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.

We are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects,  among  other  litigation,  and  we  may  also  be  subject  to  claims  involving  health  and  safety,  hazardous  materials  usage,  other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and effect of our products and services, or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties.

<!-- page break -->

Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past, and may in the future result  in  substantial  fines  and  penalties,  injunctive  relief,  ongoing  monitoring  and  auditing  obligations,  changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including divestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences. Any of these legal proceedings could also result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, and negative publicity, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and speculative process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or exceed our estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in,  and  may  in  the  future  result  in,  additional  substantial  fines,  penalties,  injunctions,  and  other  sanctions  that  could  harm  our  business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

For additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

## 10b5-1 Trading Plans

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the following Section 16 director adopted, modified, or terminated a 'Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement' (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act):

- Frances Arnold, a member of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, adopted a trading plan on July 26, 2024 (with the first trade under the plan scheduled for October 30, 2024). The trading plan will be effective until November 7, 2025 to sell 50% of the (net) shares resulting from the vesting of 3,345 (gross) shares of Class C Capital Stock, in addition to 50% of the (net) shares of any future grants awarded during the term of the plan.

There were no 'non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements' (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act) adopted, modified or  terminated  during  the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2024  by  our  directors  and  Section  16  officers.  Each  of  the  Rule  10b5-1  trading arrangements  are  in  accordance  with  our  Policy  Against  Insider  Trading  and  actual  sale  transactions  made  pursuant  to  such  trading arrangements will be disclosed publicly in Section 16 filings with the SEC in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations.

## Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On April 16, 2024, the Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Alphabet approved the accrual of dividend equivalent units to holders of all unvested stock units, subject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors of the company (which was announced

<!-- page break -->

on October 29, 2024). As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to participate in any dividends (including the one referenced above), the crediting of dividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the company when the stock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.

## Required Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Google LLC, a subsidiary of Alphabet, filed a notification with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) pursuant to Russian encryption control requirements, which must be complied with prior to the import of covered items. Neither we nor our subsidiaries generated any gross revenues or net profits directly from such activity and neither we nor our subsidiaries sell to the FSB. In the ordinary course of its business, Alphabet expects that Google LLC will continue to file these notifications as required under Russian law.
