**Text Summary:**
Daily Active Person (DAP) is defined as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device, application, or web/mobile browser on a given day. DAP numbers do not include users on other products unless they qualify based on other Family product activities. DAP calculations aim to estimate unique individuals across multiple products, using techniques and models to attribute multiple user accounts to a single person. These models are calibrated against user survey data. Starting Q4 2023, Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.
