**Text Summary:**
DAP is defined as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp ("Family" products) who visited at least one product through a mobile device or web browser on a given day. DAP numbers do not include users on other products unless they meet the Family product activity criteria. Calculations of DAP estimate unique people using one or more products, attributing multiple user accounts to a single person using complex techniques, algorithms, machine learning models, and internal reviews. These estimates have a margin of error. Beginning in Q4 2023, Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.
