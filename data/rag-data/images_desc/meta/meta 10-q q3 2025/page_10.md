**Text:**
- A daily active person (DAP) is a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (Family products) who visited at least one product through a mobile device, web, or mobile browser on a given day.
- DAP numbers do not include users on other products unless they qualify based on other Family product activities.
- Calculations attribute multiple user accounts across products to individual people, estimating unique people using complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models.
- Estimates require significant judgment and have a margin of error.
- Beginning in Q4'23, Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.
