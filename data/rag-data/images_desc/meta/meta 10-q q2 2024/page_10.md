**Text Summary:**
DAP is defined as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp who visited at least one Family product via mobile app or browser on a given day. DAP numbers exclude users on other products unless they qualify based on Family product activities. DAP calculations use complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models to estimate unique people across multiple accounts and products. These models are based on internal reviews and calibrated against user survey data. An update in methodology contributed approximately 30 million DAP to worldwide DAP in September 2022. Beginning Q4'23, Family metrics no longer include Messenger Kids users.
