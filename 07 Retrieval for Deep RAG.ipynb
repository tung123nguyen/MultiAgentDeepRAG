Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\\n\\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\\n\\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\\n\\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\\n\\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\\n\\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\\n\\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\\n\\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and distribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\\n\\n## Return Allowances\\n\\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in 'Accrued expenses and other' and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in 'Inventories' on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.\\n\\n## Cost of Sales\\n\\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in 'Fulfillment' on our consolidated statements of operations.\\n\\n## Vendor Agreements\\n\\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. V olume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\\n\\n\"),\n",

Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\\n\\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\\n\\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\\n\\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions.

Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\\n\\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\\n\\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\\n\\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\\n\\n\"),\n",

Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\\n\\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $14 million for Q1 2024.\\n\\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\\n\\n## Technology and Infrastructure\\n\\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\\n\\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The decrease in technology and infrastructure costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, partially offset by an increase in spending on infrastructure. See Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation.\\n\\n## Sales and Marketing\\n\\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\\n\\nThe decrease in sales and marketing costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to decreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, and decreased advertising expenses.\\n\\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\\n\\n## General and Administrative\\n\\nThe decrease in general and administrative costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses.\\n\\n\"),\n",

In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\\n\\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals.

Amounts held in foreign currencies were $23.5 billion and $16.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen.\\n\\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $4.8 billion and $19.0 billion for Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\n\\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(15.8) billion and $(17.9) billion for Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $13.1 billion and $13.9 billion during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect cash capital expenditures to meaningfully increase in 2024, primarily driven by investments in technology infrastructure. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $3.5 billion and $3.4 billion during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. We funded the acquisition of 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In Q3 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a note from Anthropic, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note.\\n\\n'),\n",

We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n## (unaudited)\\n\\n## Note 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES\\n\\n## Unaudited Interim Financial Information\\n\\nWe have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2024 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP') have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\n## Prior Period Reclassifications\\n\\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 'Other assets' were reclassified out of 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\\n\\n## Principles of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the 'Company'), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\\n\\n## Use of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stockbased compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\\n\\nWe review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for Q1 2024, based on servers that were included in 'Property and equipment, net' as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the three months ended March 31, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $897 million and a benefit to net income of $695 million, or $0.07 per basic share and $0.07 per diluted share.\\n\\n\"),\n",

This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\n## Accounts Receivable, Net and Other\\n\\nIncluded in 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers, as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, customer receivables, net, were $34.1 billion and $31.8 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $8.5 billion and $6.7 billion, seller receivables, net, were $1.0 billion and $0.6 billion, and other receivables, net, were $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $5.4 billion and $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\n## Digital Video and Music Content\\n\\nThe total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 were $17.4 billion and $17.9 billion. Total video and music expense was $4.0 billion and $4.6 billion in Q1 2023 and Q1 2024.\\n\\n## Unearned Revenue\\n\\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $20.9 billion, of which $6.1 billion was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Included in 'Other long-term liabilities' on our consolidated balance sheets was $5.7 billion and $6.4 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\\n\\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $157.7 billion as of March 31, 2024. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.1 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\\n\\n## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\n\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') amending existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation.

Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\\n\\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $14 million for Q1 2024.\\n\\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\\n\\n## Technology and Infrastructure\\n\\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\\n\\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The decrease in technology and infrastructure costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, partially offset by an increase in spending on infrastructure. See Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation.\\n\\n## Sales and Marketing\\n\\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\\n\\nThe decrease in sales and marketing costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to decreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, and decreased advertising expenses.\\n\\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\\n\\n## General and Administrative\\n\\nThe decrease in general and administrative costs in Q1 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses.\\n\\n\"),\n",

We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.\\n\\nInterest expense was $823 million and $644 million during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 3 - Leases and Note 5 - Debt' for additional information.\\n\\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\\n\\nOther income (expense), net was $(443) million and $(2.7) billion during Q1 2023 and Q1 2024. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(467) million and $(2.0) billion in Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, from our equity investment in Rivian.\\n\\n## Income Taxes\\n\\nOur income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $948 million, which included $48 million of net discrete tax expense. Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2.5 billion, which included $558 million of net discrete tax benefits.

Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.\\n\\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.\\n\\n## Free Cash Flow\\n\\nFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by 'Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.' The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, 'Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,' for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024 (in millions):\\n\\n|                                                                                | Twelve Months Ended March 31,   | Twelve Months Ended March 31,   |\\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\\n|                                                                                | 2023                            | 2024                            |\\n| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities                            | $ 54,330                        | $ 99,147                        |\\n| Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives | (57,649)                        | (48,998)                        |\\n| Free cash flow                                                                 | $ (3,319)                       | $ 50,149                        |\\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities                            | $ (54,313)                      | $ (51,889)                      |\\n| Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities                            | $ 14,082                        | $ (23,489)                      |\\n\\n\"),\n",

These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 8 - Segment Information.'\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, changes in fuel, utility, and food costs, interest rates, and economic outlook may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We expect some or all of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q2 2024.\\n\\n## Net Sales\\n\\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n## (unaudited)\\n\\n## Note 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES\\n\\n## Unaudited Interim Financial Information\\n\\nWe have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2024 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP') have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\n## Prior Period Reclassifications\\n\\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 'Other assets' were reclassified out of 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\\n\\n## Principles of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the 'Company'), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\\n\\n## Use of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stockbased compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\\n\\nWe review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for Q1 2024, based on servers that were included in 'Property and equipment, net' as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the three months ended March 31, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $897 million and a benefit to net income of $695 million, or $0.07 per basic share and $0.07 per diluted share.\\n\\n\")]"
