US & Canada and Europe are higher priority markets due to size and maturity, while Asia-Pacific and Rest of World monetize at lower rates. In 2024, revenue increased by 18% in US & Canada, 26% in Europe, 22% in Asia-Pacific, and 31% in Rest of World, all relative to 2023. Non-advertising revenue includes consumer hardware products, WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, developer fees, and other sources.
